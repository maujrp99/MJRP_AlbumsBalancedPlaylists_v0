# Code Quality Assessment Protocol (Reference)

## Overview
This directory contains historical evaluations of the MJRP Albums Balanced Playlists codebase. To execute a new assessment, follow the automated protocol.

## Protocol Execution
The official, step-by-step protocol is located at:
`[code-quality-assessment-protocol.md](../../../.agent/workflows/code_quality_assessment_protocol.md)`

## Core Assessment Philosophy
1.  **Metric-Driven**: Use Lines of Code (LOC) and File Counts to track growth and modularization.
2.  **Architectural Alignment**: Ensure every new feature follows established MVC, Repository, and Strategy patterns.
3.  **Technical Debt Visibility**: Use the 1-10 scoring system to highlight critical refactoring needs before they block future development.

## Historical Assessments
- [v1.0 (Initial Baseline)](CODE_QUALITY_ASSESSMENT.md)
- [v2.0 (Post-Sprint 10 Partial Refactor)](CODE_QUALITY_ASSESSMENT_v2.md)
- [v3.0 (Post-Sprint 10 Completion)](CODE_QUALITY_ASSESSMENT_v3.md)
