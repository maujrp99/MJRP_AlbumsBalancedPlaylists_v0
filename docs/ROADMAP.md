# MJRP Playlist Generator - Product Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-18
**Current Version**: v2.9.0
**Current Sprint**: Sprint 9+10 ✅ DEPLOYED | Sprint 11: Spotify Integration (Planning)

---

## 🎯 Product Vision

To empower music lovers and casual curators to transcend algorithmic bubbles by providing the definitive music curation platform. The MJRP Playlist Generator, "The Album Blender" will transform the art of playlist creation by using the intelligence of global acclaim ratings (BestEverAlbums, Musicboard) and AI enrichment (Google Gemini) to generate balanced playlists that are objectively balanced from acclaimed albums or albums from your favorite band7artist. Our vision is to be the multi-device, cloud-synced ecosystem where a passion for artist's albums meets data precision, delivering the perfect balanced album playlist experience with native integration into the largest streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music).

Sprint 8.5 - Enhancements 
(Implementation and release per phase)

Phase 1 - MJRP Balanced Cascade algorithm enhancement:
    - No momento de revisão se as playlists tem menos de 48 min, se a soma da duração da playlist DC N e da DC N+1 for menor que 48 min, faz o merge da playlists mantendo o agrupamento de ranking.



Phase- 2 UI improvements on Playlist view:
- Move MJRP Balanced Cascade to be the first displayed on the left
- Precisamos melhorar as descrições do algoritmo para ser mais didática, mais user friendly, para leigos.
- We have to "Regenerate" now (see print). Does the one in the Actions & Export section still make sense? 


Phase 3 Feature improvement on Playlist view:- o delete está deletando a Album Series inteira, deveria deletar somente a playlist
- Precisamos implementar a nomeação da playlist pelo usuario e reorganizar a UI da playlist view. O que quero dizer:
    - Uma Album Series X, pode ter a playlist serie X.1, X.2, Y, Z, todas pertencentes a albums series X. Então, cada vez que for salvar um playlist to Series History, precisamos ter o nome da playlist pra agrupar na UI da playlist view. Entende? 

Phase 4 - New suggested algorithms
- Implementar os algoritmos que vc sugeriu:
Balanced Mix	VARIETY	Distribuição igual de ratings
Timeline Journey	JOURNEY	Ordem cronológica por ano
BestEver Elite	ELITE	Só tracks com rating ≥ 80
