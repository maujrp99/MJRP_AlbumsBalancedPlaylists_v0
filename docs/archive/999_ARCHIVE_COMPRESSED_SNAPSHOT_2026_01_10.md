# Feature Specification: AlbumsView Series Filter & Architecture

**Feature Branch**: `feature/albums-view-series-filter`  
**Created**: 2025-12-14  
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Input**: User feedback on V1 spec (button alignment, expanded view behavior, default "All Series", UI grouping).

---

## Technical Architecture & Data Flow

### Core Principle: "Scope-Based Data Loading"
To prevent "Ghost Albums" (Issue #22), the `AlbumsStore` will always reflect the **current scope** (Selected Series or All Series). Switching scopes triggers a `store.reset()` followed by a fresh load. We will **not** load "All" and client-side filter for specific series views, as this risks state pollution.

### Architecture Diagrams

#### 1. Data Flow State Machine
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Initializing
    
    state "Scope: All Series" as AllScope
    state "Scope: Single Series" as SingleScope
    
    Initializing --> AllScope: Default Route (/albums)
    Initializing --> SingleScope: Series Route (/albums?seriesId=xyz)
    
    AllScope --> SingleScope: User selects Specific Series
    note on link
        1. store.reset()
        2. Load ONLY specific series queries
    end note
    
    SingleScope --> AllScope: User selects "All Series"
    note on link
        1. store.reset()
        2. Load queries from ALL series
    end note
```

#### 2. Sequence: Switching to "All Series"
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant AlbumsView
    participant AlbumSeriesStore
    participant AlbumsStore
    participant API
    
    User->>AlbumsView: Select "All Series" in Dropdown
    AlbumsView->>AlbumSeriesStore: clearActiveSeries()
    AlbumsView->>AlbumsStore: reset() ⚠️ PREVENTS GHOST ALBUMS
    
    AlbumsView->>AlbumSeriesStore: getAllSeries()
    AlbumSeriesStore-->>AlbumsView: [Series A, Series B, ...]
    
    loop For Each Series
        AlbumsView->>API: fetch(Series Queries)
        API-->>AlbumsView: [Albums]
        AlbumsView->>AlbumsStore: addAlbums(tagged with seriesId)
    end
    
    AlbumsView->>AlbumsView: render() (Grouped by Series)
```

## User Scenarios & functional Requirements

### User Story 1 - Series Dropdown & Navigation (Priority: P1)

**User Journey**:
- **Default**: Clicking "Albums" in TopNav loads **"All Series"** view by default.
- **Contextual**: Coming from "Recent Series" (Home) or "Series Manager" (Playlists) loads that specific series.
- **Switching**: User uses the dropdown to switch between "All Series" and specific series.

**Requirements**:
- **FR-001**: Dropdown MUST default to "All Series" when no ID is present in URL.
- **FR-002**: Switching series MUST trigger a full store reset and reload (Architecture constraint).
- **FR-003**: Dropdown UI MUST follow Tech Theme (Neon/Glass).

### User Story 2 - "All Series" Visual Grouping (Priority: P1)

**Visual Requirement**:
- When in "All Series" mode, albums MUST be visually grouped by their series.
- Each group MUST be separated by a **bordered area** (Tech Theme) with the Series Name clearly visible.

**Requirements**:
- **FR-004**: "All Series" render mode MUST iterate through available series and render a "Series Section" for each.
- **FR-005**: Each section MUST contain the grid of albums belonging to that series.

### User Story 3 - Album Interaction & Button Positioning (Priority: P2)

**Visual & Interaction Requirements**:
- **View Tracks**: "View Ranked" button label renamed to "View Tracks".
- **Modal**:
    - **Compact View**: Clicking album cover -> Opens "View Tracks" Modal (Same modal as Inventory/Ranked).
    - **Expanded View**: Clicking album cover -> **NO ACTION** (maintains current behavior).
- **Action Buttons** (Edit, Delete, Inventory):
    - **Position**: Justified **RIGHT** in the action bar, below the cover.
    - **Constraint**: Must NOT interfere with metadata (Artist, Year, Track Count) on the left.

**Requirements**:
- **FR-006**: Compact cards action bar layout: `[Left: Metadata] <spacer> [Right: Actions]`.
- **FR-007**: Album Modal MUST reuse existing `InventoryModals` or `RankingView` modal logic.

---

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Store & Router Updates
- Update `AlbumSeriesStore` to handle "No Active Series" as a valid state for "All Series".
- Ensure `AlbumsView.loadAlbumsFromQueries` can handle batch loading for multiple series.

### 2. UI Components
- **Series Dropdown**: Create `components/SeriesDropdown.js` (or inline in View).
    - *Style*: Glass panel, neon borders.
- **Series Grouping**: Create `renderSeriesGroup(series, albums)` helper in `AlbumsView`.
    - *Style*: `border-t border-b border-white/10` or distinct panel background.

### 3. Card Styling Updates
- **Compact Card**:
    - Update click handler for cover art.
    - Adjust footer flexbox: `justify-between` -> ensure Right alignment of buttons.
- **Expanded Card**:
    - Verify button positioning.

---

## Edge Cases

- **Empty Series**: If a series has no albums, it should still appear in "All Series" view as an empty group (or be hidden? -> *Decision: Show empty group to indicate existence*).
- **Orphaned Albums**: Albums not in any series (should not happen in current architecture).

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Switching to "All Series" should render under 1s for < 5 series.
- **Correctness**: No "Ghost Albums" (albums from Series A appearing in Series B group).

### ARCH-1: PlaylistsView Modularization

**Problem**: `PlaylistsView.js` was 960+ LOC "God Class" with coupled concerns.

**Solution**: Exploded into:
- `PlaylistsController.js` - Business logic, state management
- `PlaylistsGridRenderer.js` - Rendering logic
- `PlaylistsDragHandler.js` - Drag-and-drop behavior

**Result**: View reduced to ~300 LOC thin orchestrator.

---

### ARCH-2: Store Pattern Standardization

**Problem**: `SpotifyEnrichmentStore` didn't follow Repository pattern.

**Solution**: Created `SpotifyEnrichmentRepository` extending `BaseRepository`.

**Pattern**: All stores now follow:
```
Store (runtime state) → Repository (Firestore CRUD)
```

---

### ARCH-3: Component Reuse Foundation

**Problem**: Low component reuse (5%), duplicate card implementations.

**Solution**:
- Created `BaseCard` abstract component
- Enhanced `BatchGroupCard` with collapsible/expandable states

---

### ARCH-5: Cache Consolidation

**Problem**: Two parallel cache systems (AlbumCache + CacheManager), localStorage 5MB limit.

**Solution**:
- Migrated `AlbumCache` to use `CacheManager` as backend
- L1: Memory (MemoryCache), L2: IndexedDB (~500MB)
- Normalized cache keys (lowercase, trimmed)
- 7-day migration period from localStorage

**Files Changed**:
- `public/js/cache/albumCache.js` - Refactored to async API
- `public/js/api/client.js` - Updated to await cache methods

**Spec**: [arch-5-cache-consolidation_spec.md](technical/specs/arch-5-cache-consolidation_spec.md)

---

### ARCH-6: SeriesView Loading Optimization

**Problem**: Albums displayed all at once at end, filter changes caused full remount.

**Solution**:
- Incremental render: albums appear 1-by-1 synced with progress bar
- Store-level cache check before fetching
- Filter changes call loadScope directly (no router remount)
- Navigation back uses cached albums (instant)

**Files Changed**:
- `public/js/controllers/SeriesController.js` - Cache check, incremental notify
- `public/js/views/SeriesView.js` - Direct loadScope calls
- `public/js/stores/albums.js` - Preserve Map on reset

**Spec**: [arch-6-series-loading-optimization_spec.md](technical/specs/arch-6-series-loading-optimization_spec.md)

**Known Issue**: #95 - Series filter dropdown empty on first load (Sprint 14)

---

### ARCH-8: InventoryView V3 Refactor

**Problem**: `InventoryView.js` was a "God Class" (~800 LOC) containing logic, rendering, and event handling.

**Solution**:
- **Controller**: `InventoryController.js` handles data loading, filtering, stats, and CRUD.
- **Renderer**: `InventoryGridRenderer.js` generates pure HTML for Grid/List views.
- **View**: `InventoryView.js` acts as a thin shell for DOM patching and event delegation.

**Key Changes**:
- **Strict Ownership**: Explicit tri-state logic (Owned, Wishlist, Not Owned).
- **Currency Support**: Split stats for USD/BRL.
- **Performance**: Use `OptimizedAlbumLoader` for covers.

---

### ARCH-12: SafeDOM Migration (Sprint 15)

**Problem**: Widespread use of `innerHTML` created theoretical XSS vulnerabilities.

**Solution**:
- Created `SafeDOM.js` utility for programmatic DOM construction
- Migrated all core components (`Card`, `TrackRow`, `BaseModal`) to SafeDOM
- Added `.renderHTML()` adapters for backward compatibility

**Result**: Eliminated 50+ innerHTML sinks. See [Sprint 15 Tasks](technical/specs/sprint15-arch12/tasks.md).

---

### ARCH-13: Lazy Authorize + Browser Locale (Sprint 15 Phase 6)

**Problem**: MusicKit required `authorize()` on init, causing popup on every page load.

**Solution**:
- **Lazy Authorize**: Removed `authorize()` from `init()`, only call on Firestore persist
- **Browser Locale**: Use `navigator.language` to infer storefront (e.g., "pt-BR" → "br")
- **`authorizeAndValidate()`**: Detects storefront mismatch on persist

**Files Changed**:
- `MusicKitService.js` - `getBrowserStorefront()`, `authorizeAndValidate()`
- `SeriesModals.js` - Artist scan + filters (deprecated Autocomplete)

**Spec**: [Phase 6 Hotfix Plan](technical/specs/sprint15-arch12/phase6-hotfix-plan.md)

---

### ARCH-14: Context-Aware Series Loading (Sprint 16)

**Problem**: "Cross-contamination" of albums between series due to fuzzy matching in `AlbumsScopedRenderer`. Albums like "Blonde" (Frank Ocean) would appear in "Bob Dylan" series (matching "Blonde on Blonde").

**Solution**:
- **Context Preservation**: `SeriesController` attaches `_sourceSeriesId` to queries during load.
- **Strict Ownership**: Albums are tagged with `seriesIds` indicating exactly which series requested/owns them.
- **Precise Rendering**: View uses strict ID inclusion checks instead of fuzzy string matching.

**Files Changed**:
- `SeriesController.js`
- `AlbumsScopedRenderer.js`
- `albumsStore.js`

---

### ARCH-18: Album Classification Modularization (Sprint 17.75)

**Problem**: Classification logic (~100 LOC) embedded inline in `AlbumSearchService._classifyWithAI()` as a "God Method" with multiple responsibilities: DJ Mix detection, track count heuristics, electronic genre detection, AI whitelist checking.

**Solution**: Extracted into modular **5-stage funnel** using Chain of Responsibility pattern:
1. `AppleMetadataStrategy` - Uses Apple API flags (`isSingle`, `isCompilation`, `albumType`, `contentTraits`)
2. `TitleKeywordStrategy` - Pattern matching (Live, DJ Mix, EP, Remix, etc.)
3. `RemixTracksStrategy` - Track analysis (≥50% remix tracks = remix package)
4. `TrackCountStrategy` - Track count + duration (with prog rock protection)
5. `AIWhitelistStrategy` - AI confirmation for electronic music
6. `TypeSanityCheckStrategy` - Final post-processing safety net (e.g., force "Hello World" to EP)

**Files Created**:
- `AlbumTypeClassifier.js` - Pipeline orchestrator
- `classification/BaseStrategy.js` - Abstract interface
- `classification/AppleMetadataStrategy.js`, `TitleKeywordStrategy.js`, etc.

**Result**:
- `album.type` property set by centralized classifier
- Backward-compatible flags (`isSingle`, `isCompilation`, `isLive`) maintained
- Single Source of Truth for classification across all consumers

**Spec**: [sprint17.75-classification-modularization/spec.md](technical/specs/sprint17.75-classification-modularization/spec.md)

## Core Domain Models
**Principles**: Universal Series Model, Golden Pipeline
**Defined in**: `docs/CONSTITUTION.md`

### 1. Universal Series Model
All curation contexts are treated as a **Series**. This abstracts the difference between an Album, an Artist, or a Genre.
- **Entity**: The base unit (Album, Track, Artist).
- **Series**: A collection of entities treated as a unit for ranking/shuffling.
- **Naming**: `AlbumSeries`, `ArtistSeries`, `TrackSeries`.

### 2. The Golden Pipeline
The standard data flow for all curation actions:
`Input (Entity/Series)` -> `RankingContext (Config)` -> `Blending Menu (Algorithm)` -> `Standardized Output (Playlist)`

## [V3 Component Architecture (Series-Centric)]
**Status**: 🟢 Current
**Date**: 2025-12-21 17:15
**Author**: Antigravity (AI Assistant)
**Related Issues**: Sprint 12, #Refactor

### Problem Statement
The application relying on monolithic Views (`AlbumsView.js`) created a "God Class" problem: coupled logic, DOM manipulation, and state management in single files of 600+ lines. This violated the "Separation of Concerns" principle and made adding features like the "Blending Menu" risky.

### Decisions & Patterns (V3)
We adopted a **Responsive Component-Based Architecture** using Vanilla JS.

| Pattern | Role in V3 | Why we chose it |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Component-Based** | Visuals (`EntityCard`, `SeriesHeader`) | Encapsulates HTML/CSS generation and local event binding. Reusable across Views. |
| **MVC (Controller)** | Logic (`SeriesController`) | Decouples business logic (Filtering, Fetching) from the View. |
| **Observer** | State (`Stores`) | Allows components to react to data changes without prop-drilling. |
| **Repository** | Data (`AlbumRepository`) | Abstracts the data source (Firestore vs Local) from the Controller. |

### Rationale
**Principle Alignment**: **Clean Code & Modular Architecture** (Constitution II)
- **Modularity**: Components are "Lego blocks" (e.g., `SeriesDragDrop` can be attached to any grid).
- **Maintainability**: Logic changes in `SeriesController` don't break the UI in `SeriesView`.
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM is overkill; direct DOM manipulation within small Components is efficient.

### Component Hierarchy
```mermaid
graph TD
    App[App Entry] --> Router
    Router --> SeriesView["SeriesView (Orchestrator)"]

    subgraph "View Layer (Components)"
        SeriesView --> SeriesHeader[Series Header (Meta & Actions)]
        SeriesView --> SeriesFilterBar[Filter & Search Bar]
        SeriesView --> SeriesGrid[Series Grid (Responsive)]
        SeriesGrid --> EntityCard[Entity Card (Album/Artist)]
        SeriesView --> BlendingMenuView[Blending Menu (Overlay)]
    end

    subgraph "Logic Layer"
        SeriesView -.Events.-> SeriesController[Series Controller]
        SeriesController --> DataStores[Data Stores/Repositories]
    end
```

### Key Data Structures

#### RankingContext
The contract between the UI and the Curation Engine for the **Blending Menu**.

```json
{
  "style": "balanced_cascade",
  "targetDuration": 2700,
  "parameters": {
    "strictness": 0.8,
    "p1_count": 1,
    "deep_cut_ratio": 0.5
  },
  "scope": { "type": "series", "id": "series_123" },
  "sources": [
    { "id": "bea", "weight": 1.0 },
    { "id": "spotify", "weight": 0.8 }
  ]
}
```

### Consequences
- ✅ **Benefits**:
    - **Testability**: Logic can be unit-tested without a browser.
    - **Scalability**: New Views (Inventory, Playlists) are just assemblies of existing Components.
    - **Responsiveness**: CSS-driven layouts (Tailwind) handled in Components, not JS.
- ⚠️ **Trade-offs**:
    - **Complexity**: Requires strictly defined interfaces between layers (`props`, `callbacks`).
- 🔴 **Risks**:
    - **Migration Overhead**: Porting 100% of `AlbumsView` features (Drag&Drop, Context Menu) takes significant effort.

### Implementation Status
- [x] Design approved (Plan V3)
- [x] Infrastructure (Base Component, Controller)
- [x] Core Components (Grid, Card, Header, Filter)

## Design Patterns & Core Strategies

The application is built on a modular architecture using standard design patterns to ensure scalability and maintainability.

### 1. Strategy Pattern
Used for interchangeable behaviors:
- **ViewMode Strategy**: Decouples rendering (Compact vs Expanded) from view logic.
- **Algorithm Strategy**: Pluggable playlist generation algorithms (Cascade, S-Draft, TopN).
- **Ranking Strategy**: Pluggable ranking sources (Spotify, BEA, Balanced).

### 2. Mixin Pattern (Sprint 12)
Reusable algorithm behaviors extracted from legacy algorithms:
- `PlaylistBalancingMixin`: Swap balancing logic for track distribution
- `DurationTrimmingMixin`: Playlist duration enforcement
- `TrackEnrichmentMixin`: Track metadata enrichment

**Location**: `public/js/algorithms/mixins/`

### 3. Repository Pattern
Abstracts Firestore interactions. All data access is centralized in `*Repository` classes, ensuring consistent schema handling and CRUD operations.

### 3. Observer Pattern
The core of state management. Stores notify registered views of changes, allowing for a reactive UI without a heavy framework like React.

### 4. Key Patterns Summary

| Pattern | Location | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Dependency Injection** | Server Routes / View Renderers | Injecting services or context objects into handlers |
| **State Machine** | `PlaylistsStore.mode` | Managing CREATE vs EDIT workflow states |
| **Barrel Export** | `views/*/index.js` | Single entry point for cleaner module imports |
| **Facade** | `MusicKitService.js` / `SpotifyService.js` | Simplified interfaces for complex external APIs |

---

## Router & View Lifecycle

The application uses a custom client-side router based on the History API (`pushState`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Detailed sequence diagrams and lifecycle method definitions are documented in [data_flow_architecture.md](technical/data_flow_architecture.md#view-lifecycle--navigation).

### Registered Routes

| Path | View | Query Params |
|------|------|--------------|
| `/home` | HomeView | - |
| `/albums` | SeriesView (V3) | `?seriesId=X` |
| `/blend` | BlendingMenuView | - |
| `/playlists` | PlaylistsView | - |
| `/playlist-series` | SavedPlaylistsView | - |
| `/save-all` | SaveAllView | - |
| `/ranking/:albumId` | RankingView | - |
| `/ranking/consolidated` | ConsolidatedRankingView | - |
| `/inventory` | InventoryView | - |

---

## Domain Model Architecture

We use ES6 classes to encapsulate business logic and data integrity:

- **`Album`**: The central entity. Manages track orderings (Original, Balanced, Acclaim) and Spotify popularity data.
- **`Track`**: Value object ensuring metadata consistency (Artist, Album, Rank, Score).
- **`Playlist`**: Grouping of tracks with specific sequence and duration logic.
- **`Series`**: The curation context (e.g., "The Black Crowes - Essential Mix").

---

## Store State Management

Stores manage the application's runtime state and synchronization with Firestore.

- **Persistence**: Hybrid approach using Memory (L1) -> IndexedDB/Local (L2) -> Firestore (Remote).
- **TTL**: Cache entries for external API data (BestEver, Spotify) have a 7-day expiration.
- **Isolation**: All operations are scoped to `auth.currentUser.uid`.

---

## UI/UX Standards

### Iconography
- **Rule**: **Do NOT use Emojis for UI icons.**
- **Standard**: Use SVG icons from the centralized `Icons.js` registry. This ensures consistent rendering across platforms and CSS-based styling.

### Design Tokens
- **Typography**: Syne (Headers) / Inter (Body).
- **Theme**: Premium Dark (Flame/Amber accents).
- **Components**: Glassmorphism based cards with subtle hover effects.

---

## Firebase Integration Guide

- **SDK Version**: v11.6.1 (Modular).
- **Authentication**: Google & Apple OAuth via Firebase Auth.
- **Security**: Granular Firestore rules ensuring users can only read/write their own `curator` and `inventory` documents.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always deep-serialize objects (JSON) before sending to Firestore to remove class instances and `undefined` values that would cause SDK errors.

---

## Caching & Performance

> [!NOTE]
> **ARCH-5 Update (2025-12-26)**: Cache architecture consolidated to use IndexedDB.

### Cache Architecture (Post ARCH-5)

```mermaid
graph LR
    API[apiClient] --> AC[AlbumCache<br/>facade]
    AC --> CM[CacheManager]
    CM --> L1[(Memory L1)]
    CM --> L2[(IndexedDB L2)]
```

| Layer | Storage | Capacity | Persistence |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **L1** | MemoryCache (Map) | ~50MB | Session only |
| **L2** | IndexedDB | ~500MB | Permanent (7-day TTL) |

### Key Features
- **Normalized Keys**: `album:artist - title` (lowercase, trimmed)
- **Migration**: 7-day dual-read from legacy localStorage
- **Async API**: `await albumCache.get()` / `await albumCache.set()`

---

## [V1/V2 Monolithic View Pattern]
**Status**: 🟡 Superseded
**Date**: 2024-01-01 (Legacy)

### Description
Previous architecture relied on `View.js` classes that directly manipulated the DOM and handled all logic internally.
**Deficiencies**:
- Hard to test.
- Duplicate logic (Copy/Paste between Albums and Inventory).
- "God Class" antipattern.

**See**: [V3 Component Architecture](#v3-component-architecture-series-centric)

--------------------------------------------------
# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to the MJRP Albums Balanced Playlists project.

## v3.15.5 - Sprint 15.5: Prod Polish & Blending Fixes (2026-01-02)

**Status**: 🚀 **RELEASED**
**Tag**: `v3.15.5`
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary
Sprint 15.5 focused on polishing the Blending Menu UX and standardizing algorithm naming. This release introduces self-explanatory algorithm names, grouping strategies for track organization, and improved UI visibility logic.

### ✨ New Features
- **Grouping Tracks**: New parameter in Blending Menu to control playlist structure:
  - `By Album`: Preserves album order (default)
  - `Global Rank`: Interleaved by rank (1s, 2s, 3s...)
  - `Artist Cluster`: Grouped by artist name
  - `Shuffle`: Randomized order
- **Sequential Distribution**: Multiple Playlists now fill sequentially (preserves grouping) instead of round-robin.

### 🛠 Improvements
- **Algorithm Renaming** (Self-Explanatory Names):
  - `Crowd Favorites` → `Top 3 Tracks by Spotify Popularity`
  - `Critic's Choice` → `Top 3 Acclaimed Tracks on BestEverAlbums`

- Moved documentation files to organized locations:
  - DevOps: LOCAL_RUN.md, PRODUCTION_DEPLOY.md, SECRET_ROTATION_RUNBOOK.md, SECURITY.md
  - Product: PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, SPRINT_5_UI_SPECS.md, V2.0_ANALYSIS.md
  - Archive: HOTFIX_RANKING_ACCLAIM.md, IMPACT_ANALYSIS.md, troubleshooting_log.md
- Created `docs/README.md` as documentation index
- Consolidated `troubleshooting_log.md` into `DEBUG_LOG.md`
- Moved `DEBUG_LOG.md` to `/docs/` root
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with cross-references

#### Phase 2: UI Enhancement (Steps 7-10)
- Added MJRP realistic logo to hero section (`HomeView.js`)
- Fixed logo background transparency (external tool → `sips` verification)
- Added cache-busting (`?v=${Date.now()}`) to force logo reload
- Positioned logo on right side, matching left icon size

#### Phase 3: Git Commit (Steps 11-13)
- Staged all changes (`git add -A`)
- Committed: "docs: consolidate architecture documentation + add MJRP logo to hero"
- Created tag `v2.0.1-docs-consolidation`

#### Phase 4: Domain Model Analysis (Steps 14-17)
- Identified root cause: "Anemic Domain Model" (raw JSON passing)

  - `public/js/models/Track.js` - Guarantees artist/album context
  - `public/js/models/Album.js` - Manages tracks and tracksOriginalOrder
  - `public/js/models/Playlist.js` - Playlist domain logic
  - `public/js/models/Series.js` - Series aggregation
- Refactored `client.js`: Returns `new Album(data)`, added hydration
- Refactored `curation.js`: Uses Album/Track models, added guard
- Updated `AlbumsStore.js`: Prevents instance → plain object conversion

#### Phase 6: Critical Bug Fixes (Steps 23-25)
- **Issue #9: Axios Reference Error**

   - Cache integration (L1 + L2)
   - Schema versioning support
   - Server timestamp handling

2. **SeriesRepository**
   - User-scoped collection: `users/{userId}/series`
   - `rename()` with validation (min 3 chars)
   - `deleteWithCascade()` - deletes albums + playlists
   - `createFromInventory()` - create series from inventory albums
   - `findWithAlbums()` - load series with albums

3. **AlbumRepository**
   - User + Series scoped: `users/{userId}/series/{seriesId}/albums`
   - `updateTracks()` - update track array
   - `findByArtist()`, `findByYear()` - query methods
   - Schema version 2 (added `tracksOriginalOrder`, `bestEverUrl`)

4. **PlaylistRepository**
   - User + Series scoped: `users/{userId}/series/{seriesId}/playlists`
   - `rename()`, `updateTracks()`
   - `getTotalDuration()` - calculate playlist length

5. **InventoryRepository** ⭐ **NEW FEATURE**
   - User-scoped: `users/{userId}/inventory/albums`
   - Manage physical album collection (CD, Vinyl, DVD, Blu-ray, Digital)
   - `addAlbum(album, format, options)` - add to collection
   - `updateAlbum()` - edit format, price, notes
   - `removeAlbum()` - delete from collection
   - `findByFormat()` - filter by format
   - `getStatistics()` - count, total value, average price
   - `search(query)` - search by artist/title

**Tests**: 20/20 passing ✅

---

#### Added - Cache Layer (Phase 2)

**3-Tier Cache System**:

1. **MemoryCache (L1)** - Fast session cache
   - In-memory Map storage

   - Performance: ~1-5ms

2. **IndexedDBCache (L2)** - Persistent cross-tab cache
   - IndexedDB storage (500MB+ capacity)
   - Async operations with TTL
   - Cross-tab synchronization
   - Graceful fallback if unavailable
   - Performance: ~10-30ms

3. **CacheManager** - Unified cache interface
   - L1 + L2 coordination
   - Auto-promotion (L2 hit → L1)
   - Schema version validation
   - Graceful IndexedDB fallback
   - Cache statistics

**Read Flow**: L1 (memory) → L2 (IndexedDB) → Firestore  
**Write Flow**: L1 (sync) + L2 (async) + Firestore

**Tests**: 14/14 passing ✅

---

#### Added - Migration Utility (Phase 3 - Partial)

**MigrationUtility** - localStorage → Firestore migration:
- Auto-detect legacy localStorage data
- Progress tracking with callbacks
- Rollback backup creation
- Error collection (continues on failures)

## v2.0.0-alpha.6 Sprint 4.5 Phase 2: Albums View Modes (2025-11-28)

**Status**: ⚠️ **Partially Completed** - Tagged as `sprint4.5-partially-completed`

### Summary
Implemented MODE 3 (Expanded List View) for Albums with dual tracklists (Ranked by Acclaim + Original Album Order). Encountered localStorage cache invalidation issue with new normalized fields. **Decision**: Defer complete fix to Sprint 5 (Firestore) for proper data persistence and schema versioning.

### Features Implemented

**MODE 3: Expanded List View** ✅
- Vertical list layout showing all albums simultaneously
- Each album displays dual tracklists side-by-side:
  - **Ranked by Acclaim**: Sorted by rating (descending) with medals 🥇🥈🥉 for top 3
  - **Original Album Order**: AS IS from API (`data.tracks`)
- All tracks visible (no pagination/truncation)
- Premium glassmorphism design matching MODE 2

**View Mode Toggle** ✅
- Button in filter bar to switch between Compact Grid (MODE 1) and Expanded List (MODE 3)
- Full view re-render on toggle with event listener re-attachment
- ViewMode state persists in localStorage

**Series Title UI Enhancement** ✅
- Larger 4xl font size with bold styling
- "Series Name:" label prefix for clarity
- Album count in accent color (prominent display)
- Removed "Consolidated View" badge (cleaner UX)

### Known Issues (Deferred to Sprint 5)

**localStorage Cache Invalidation** ⚠️

**Problem**:
Albums cached before code changes lack new normalized fields (`bestEverAlbumId`, `bestEverUrl`, `tracksOriginalOrder`), resulting in `undefined` values when loaded from cache.

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
// Cache hit bypasses normalizeAlbumData()
✅ L2 cache hit (localStorage): Album X
   ↓ (No re-normalization)
   ↓  
{
  bestEverAlbumId: undefined,      // ❌ Missing
  bestEverUrl: undefined,          // ❌ Missing
  tracksOriginalOrder: undefined   // ❌ Missing
}
```

**Current Workaround**:
- ✅ "Refresh" button in AlbumsView header forces skip-cache reload
- ✅ "Clear Cache" in footer + page reload
- ⚠️ Requires manual user action

**Why Deferred to Sprint 5**:

1. **Firestore >> localStorage**
   - Schema versioning built-in
   - No size limits (~5MB localStorage vs unlimited Firestore)
   - Automatic field migration via Firestore rules
   - Timestamp-based cache invalidation

2. **Architectural Alignment**
   - Sprint 5 replaces localStorage with Firestore entirely
   - Proper persistence layer with offline support
   - Single source of truth for all album data

3. **Limited Impact**
   - Only affects existing cached albums
   - New albums normalize correctly
   - Users can manually refresh when needed

### Files Modified
```
public/js/api/client.js                # +50 lines - Debug logging, BestEver fields extraction
public/js/views/AlbumsView.js          # +120 lines - MODE 3 rendering, Refresh button, dual tracklists
docs/troubleshooting_log.md           # +88 lines - Sprint 4.5 Phase 2 issues documented
```

### Implementation Details

**Data Flow** (MODE 3):
```javascript
// API Response has TWO track arrays:
data.tracks              // Original album order (AS IS)
data.tracksByAcclaim     // Sorted by rating (ranked)

// Normalization preserves both:
normalized.tracks = tracksByAcclaim        // Primary for UI
normalized.tracksOriginalOrder = data.tracks  // For "Original Album Order" list

// Rendering:
renderRankedTracklist(album.tracks)                    // Shows acclaim ranking
renderOriginalTracklist(album.tracksOriginalOrder)     // Shows AS IS order
```

**Refresh Button Flow**:
```javascript
// User clicks Refresh
→ loadAlbumsFromQueries(queries, skipCache=true)
  → apiClient.fetchMultipleAlbums(queries, onProgress, skipCache=true)
    → fetchAlbum(query, skipCache=true)  // Bypasses cache
      → _fetchAlbumFromAPI()  // Fresh fetch
        → normalizeAlbumData(data)  // All fields populated ✅
```

### Next Steps (Sprint 5)

**Firestore Persistence Architecture**:
- [ ] Replace localStorage with Firestore for album storage
- [ ] Implement schema versioning (e.g., `_schemaVersion: 2`)
- [ ] Migrate existing localStorage → Firestore on first load
- [ ] Add `lastFetched` timestamp for cache invalidation strategy
- [ ] Implement offline-first sync (Firestore + local cache)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Proper data persistence across devices
- ✅ No cache invalidation issues
- ✅ Edit/delete album functionality  
- ✅ Collaborative series sharing (future Sprint 6)

## v2.0.0-alpha.5 Sprint 4.5 Phase 1: Landing View UI/UX (2025-11-28)

**Status**: In development (feature/v2.0-foundation branch)

### Summary
Finalized the Landing View (HomeView) UI/UX with a premium "Nebula" theme. Implemented a dynamic SVG background generator for the Hero Banner, a new SVG logo, and fixed critical styling issues by integrating Tailwind CSS.

### Features

**Hero Banner Overhaul**:
- **Dynamic SVG Background**:
  - Created `SvgGenerator.js` utility to generate mathematical equalizer patterns.
  - Implemented "Vibrant Spectrum" gradient (Green -> Yellow -> Red).
  - Configured for 33% height occupancy to leave room for copy.
  - Generated unique `hero_bg.svg` using server-side script.
- **New Logo**:
  - Created `MJRPLogo` SVG (Vinyl Record with Flame) in `Icons.js`.
  - Replaced placeholder icon in TopNav and Hero.

**Styling Infrastructure**:
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**:
  - Added Tailwind CDN to `index-v2.html` (was previously missing).
  - Configured basic theme extension.
  - Removed conflicting legacy styles.

**Developer Tools**:
- **SVG Debugger**:
  - Created `public/debug-svg-generator.html` for real-time visualization of SVG generation logic.
  - Allows tweaking parameters (columns, gap, height ratio) visually.

### Fixes

1. **Missing Styles** (Critical):
   - **Issue**: Header, Footer, and Hero were unstyled on localhost.
   - **Fix**: Added `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>` to `index-v2.html`.
   - **Impact**: UI now renders correctly with all Tailwind classes applied.

2. **SVG Generation**:
   - **Issue**: Initial SVG generation script failed due to ESM/CommonJS mismatch.
   - **Fix**: Updated `scripts/generate_hero_svg.js` to use ESM imports.

### Files Added
```
public/js/utils/SvgGenerator.js        # Generic SVG generation logic
public/debug-svg-generator.html        # Visual debugger for SVGs
scripts/generate_hero_svg.js           # Server-side generation script
public/assets/images/hero_bg.svg       # Generated background asset
```

### Files Modified

## v2.0.0-alpha.4 Sprint 4: Playlists Management (2025-11-26)

**Status**: In development (feature/v2.0-foundation branch)

### Summary
Implemented complete playlist management system with drag-and-drop editing, undo/redo version history, and backend API integration. Users can now generate balanced playlists from ranked albums, reorder tracks interactively, and export to JSON.

### Features

**PlaylistsStore Enhancement** (+85 lines):
- **Version History System**:
  - Snapshot-based undo/redo (max 20 versions)
  - Automatic snapshot creation on track moves/reorders
  - `undo()` / `redo()` methods with state restoration
  - `getVersionHistory()` with current version indicator
  - Version pruning when undoing then making new changes
- **State Management**:

  - Playlist count selector (3-5)
  - **Min/max duration per playlist inputs (30-60 min default)**
  - "Generate Playlists" button with loading state
  - Warning if no albums loaded
- **Playlists Grid**:
  - Responsive columns (auto-fit, 300px min)
  - Editable playlist names (contenteditable)
  - Playlist stats (track count, duration)
  - Track items with drag handles (⋮⋮)
- **Drag & Drop**:
  - Reorder tracks within same playlist
  - Move tracks between playlists
  - Visual feedback (`.dragging`, `.drag-over`)

  - Card styling consistency

### Implementation Details

**Version History Pattern**:
```javascript
createSnapshot(description) {
  // Remove future versions if undid then changed
  if (currentIndex < versions.length - 1) {
    versions = versions.slice(0, currentIndex + 1)
  }
  
  // Add snapshot with deep clone
  versions.push({
    playlists: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(playlists)),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    description
  })
  
  // Enforce max limit
  if (versions.length > maxVersions) {
    versions.shift()
  }
}
```

**Drag & Drop Flow**:
1. `dragstart`: Capture source playlist/track indices → `.dragging`
2. `dragover`: Prevent default, add `.drag-over` to target
3. `drop`: Call `moveTrack()` or `reorderTrack()` based on target
4. `dragend`: Clear drag state, remove visual classes

**Backend Payload**:
```json
{
  "albums": [
    {
      "title": "Album Name",
      "artist": "Artist Name",
      "tracks": [
        { "title": "Track", "rank": 1, "rating": 95, "duration": 240 }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "options": {
    "targetCount": 4,
    "minTracksPerPlaylist": 8,
    "maxTracksPerPlaylist": 15
  }
}
```

### Bug Fixes (Hotfixes 2025-11-27)

1.  **SeriesStore ID Mismatch** (Critical):
    -   **Issue**: `HomeView` generated a temporary ID (`series_...`) which was overwritten by `SeriesStore` (`Date.now()`), causing `AlbumsView` to fail loading the series on initial navigation (URL ID mismatch).
    -   **Fix**: Updated `SeriesStore.createSeries` to respect provided IDs and updated `HomeView` to use the returned ID.
    -   **Impact**: Fixed "No albums in library" empty state on first load.

2.  **PlaylistsView Reactivity**:
    -   **Issue**: `PlaylistsView` lacked an `update()` method implementation, causing the UI to remain static after generation or state changes.
    -   **Fix**: Implemented `update()` to re-render grid, undo/redo controls, and toggle sections dynamically.
    -   **Impact**: Playlist generation now updates the view immediately.

3.  **Ratings Display**:
    -   **Issue**: Ratings were missing from frontend due to missing mapping in backend and strict checks in frontend.
    -   **Fix**: Added `ratingMap` in backend `server/index.js` and relaxed frontend `hasRatings` check.
    -   **Impact**: "✓ Rated" badges now appear correctly for supported albums.

4.  **UX Improvements**:
    -   **Clear Cache**: Added "Troubleshooting Tools" section with Clear Cache button to `HomeView`.
    -   **Error Feedback**: Replaced `alert()` with inline red error messages in `PlaylistsView`.
    -   **Timestamps**: Added "Last updated" footer to views for visual liveness confirmation.

5.  **Series Mixing (Ghost Albums)**:
    -   **Issue**: Albums from previous series persisted when switching series (e.g., Test 14 albums showing in Test 11).
    -   **Fix**: Added `albumsStore.reset()` before loading new series albums in `AlbumsView`.
    -   **Impact**: Clean state when switching contexts.

6.  **Playlist Rank Display**:
    -   **Issue**: Track rank showed as "-" in playlists.
    -   **Fix**: Updated `client.js` normalization to fallback to `acclaimRank` or `finalPosition` if `rank` is missing.
    -   **Impact**: "Rank: X" correctly displayed in playlist cards.

### Bug Fixes

1. **Import Statement** (Syntax):
   - **Issue**: `import { router, } from '../router.js'` (trailing comma)
   - **Fix**: Removed trailing comma
   - **Impact**: PlaylistsView now loads without syntax error

2. **Vite Dev Server** (Configuration):
   - **Issue**: Server needed restart after middleware changes
   - **Fix**: Restarted dev server
   - **Impact**: `/playlists` route now serves correctly

### Testing & Verification

**Manual Testing**:
- ✅ Navigate to `/playlists` directly
- ✅ Playlist generation form displays
- ⏸️ Generate playlists (requires backend `/api/playlists` endpoint)
- ⏸️ Drag-and-drop reordering
- ⏸️ Undo/redo functionality
- ✅ JSON export downloads file

**Note**: Full end-to-end testing pending backend `/api/playlists` implementation

### Files Added

```

### Performance & UX

- **Version History**: O(1) undo/redo via index tracking
- **Drag & Drop**: Event delegation (single listener per container)
- **JSON Export**: Client-side with `Blob` and `URL.createObjectURL`
- **Loading State**: Overlay with spinner during generation
- **Disabled States**: Buttons auto-disable when actions unavailable

### Architecture Decisions

**Why Version History?**
- Users experiment with track ordering
- Easy to undo mistakes without fear
- Industry standard (Spotify, Logic Pro, etc.)

**Why Immutable Snapshots?**
- Prevents reference bugs
- Simplifies undo/redo logic
- Small memory cost (~10KB per snapshot)

**Why JSON Export First?**
- No OAuth dependency (Sprint 5-6)
- Useful for backup/debugging
- Foundation for Spotify/Apple Music exports

### Next Steps (Sprint 5-6)

**Sprint 5: Spotify Integration**
- OAuth authentication
- Spotify Web API playlist creation
- Track matching by ISRC
- Error handling for unmatched tracks

**Sprint 6: Apple Music Integration**
- MusicKit JS setup
- Apple Music API playlist creation
- Track matching
- Cross-platform export options

### Notes

- Backend `/api/playlists` exists in v1.6.1 (tested and working)
- v2.0 frontend ready for backend integration
- Drag-and-drop UX matches modern playlist tools
- Version history limited to 20 to prevent memory bloat
- All changes on `feature/v2.0-foundation` branch

- Registered `/ranking/:albumId` route with param extraction
- Updated HomeView navigation flow
- Integrated with History API middleware

**Store Updates**:
- Extended `AlbumsStore.addAlbum()` with track metadata normalization
- Added `normalizeTrack()` method for extensible metadata:
  ```javascript
  metadata: {
    isrc: null,
    appleMusicId: null,
    spotifyId: null
  }
  ```

**Vite Configuration**:
- Custom plugin `v2-spa-fallback` for SPA routing
- Middleware to serve `index-v2.html` for `/home`, `/albums`, `/ranking` routes
- Preserved proxy for `/api` → `http://localhost:3000`
- Fixed: Syntax error in middleware array

**Styling** (~500 lines CSS):
- Albums grid with hover effects and transforms
- Progress bar with gradient animation
- Ranking table with row highlighting
- Tab navigation with active indicators
- Rating badge color system
- Source badge gradients
- Loading overlay with spinner animation
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet

### Testing & Verification

**Backend API**: ✅
- Successfully tested with `curl`
- Album data returned with tracks and ratings
- Average response time: 10-15 seconds

**Manual Testing**: ✅
- Series creation → Albums loading → Ranking display
- Progress bar shows correctly during fetch
- Cache works (instant load on second visit)
- Search/filter functional
- Tab switching smooth
- Back navigation works

### Bug Fixes

1. **API Client Payload** (Critical):
   - **Issue**: Backend expected `{albumQuery}`, client sent `{artist, album}`
   - **Fix**: Changed request body to `JSON.stringify({ albumQuery: query })`
   - **Impact**: Albums now load successfully from API

2. **Vite Configuration** (Blocker):
   - **Issue**: `/home` route served `hybrid-curator.html` (v1.6.1) instead of `index-v2.html`
   - **Fix**: Added custom middleware plugin for SPA route fallback
   - **Impact**: v2.0 routes now work correctly

### Documentation Added

## v1.6.1 Hotfix: Production Deployment (2025-11-26)

### Summary
Fixed critical production deployment issue where track ratings were not appearing in production environment despite working correctly in local development.

### Root Cause
Multiple configuration and module loading issues in the Cloud Run container deployment:
1. **Missing Config Files**: `config/prompts.json` was not being copied to the container, causing `loadPrompts()` to fail silently and `fetchRankingForAlbum` to return empty results immediately.
2. **Shared Module Path**: `shared/normalize.js` was not accessible at the expected import path within the container.
3. **ESM Configuration**: The shared module lacked proper ESM configuration (`package.json` with `"type": "module"`), causing import failures.

### Fixes Applied

**Deployment Script (`scripts/deploy-backend.sh`)**:
- Added copying of `config/` directory to `server/config/` before Cloud Run build
- Added copying of `shared/` directory to `server/_shared_temp/` with ESM package.json injection
- Added cleanup of temporary directories after deployment

**Module Loading (`server/lib/prompts.js`)**:
- Updated to check multiple paths for `prompts.json`: container path (`../config/`) and local path (`../../config/`)
- Added graceful fallback between paths using `fs.existsSync()`

**Shared Module (`shared/normalize.js`)**:
- Deployment script now creates `{"type": "module"}` package.json in the shared directory
- Ensures proper ESM handling by Node.js in the container

**Frontend Cache Busting (`public/hybrid-curator.html`)**:
- Added `?v=1.6.0` cache buster to app.js script tag to force browser reload of updated logic

### Debug Instrumentation Added
- Created `/api/debug/files` endpoint to inspect container filesystem
- Created `/api/debug/import` endpoint to test dynamic module imports  
- Enhanced `/api/debug/raw-ranking` to return full error details
- Added `debugTrace` to `fetchRankingForAlbum` to track execution flow
- Exposed debug metadata in API responses via `rankingConsolidatedMeta`

### Verification
Tested with production API:
```bash
curl -X POST https://mjrp-proxy-540062660076.southamerica-east1.run.app/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"albumQuery": "Rolling Stones - Let it Bleed"}'
```

**Results**:
- ✅ `Has Ratings: true` (previously `false`)
- ✅ 9 tracks with ratings from BestEverAlbums
- ✅ Sample: "Gimme Shelter" with rating 93
- ✅ Debug trace confirms full pipeline execution: scraper → ratings → consolidation

### Files Modified
- `scripts/deploy-backend.sh`: Added config/shared copying and cleanup
- `server/lib/prompts.js`: Multi-path config loading
- `server/lib/fetchRanking.js`: Debug tracing
- `server/index.js`: Debug endpoint enhancements, debug metadata exposure
- `public/hybrid-curator.html`: Cache busting

### Notes
- Debug endpoints (`/api/debug/*`) should be disabled or protected in production deployment
- Consider adding health check endpoint that validates config/module loading
- Future: Add automated smoke tests that verify `/api/generate` returns ratings

---

## v1.5 Refactor (2025-11-25)

### Architecture
- **Shared Logic**: Created `shared/normalize.js` as an ES module used by both frontend and backend to ensure consistent key normalization.
- **Frontend**: Refactored `curation.js` into a stateless `CurationEngine` class, decoupling it from the DOM. Updated `app.js` to use this engine.
- **Backend**: Modularized `server/index.js` by extracting ranking logic into `server/lib/fetchRanking.js` and `server/lib/ranking.js`. Implemented dynamic imports for shared ESM modules.

### Fixes
- **Connectivity**: Addressed external scraper connectivity issues by increasing timeouts and adding browser-like User-Agent headers in `server/lib/scrapers/besteveralbums.js`. Note: Environment restrictions may still block specific sites.
- **Curation**: Fixed a regression where `curateAlbums` was undefined in `app.js` by switching to `CurationEngine`.

### Verification
- Unit tests passed for backend modules.
- Manual verification performed on localhost.

---

## Release: BEA-RankingAcclaim-Implemented (2025-11-23)

Summary
- Added scraper-first ranking provenance using BestEverAlbums when available.
- Server exposes per-track `bestEverEvidence`, `bestEverAlbumId` and per-track `rating` in the album payload returned by `/api/generate`.
- Merge logic: when scraper evidence is partial, model outputs are used to enrich missing tracks; scraper entries take precedence for matched tracks.
- Frontend: consolidated ranking UI updated to prefer server-side `rankingConsolidated` and surface BestEver sources first.

Verification
- Unit and integration tests added under `server/test/`. Local `npm test` passed during development.

---

## Hotfix: BestEver suggest fast-accept & fuzzy matching (2025-11-25)

Summary
- Problem: the BestEver `suggest.php` sometimes returned candidate results pointing to non-canonical pages (tributes, live versions). In some album queries (notably *Pink Floyd — The Wall*) the scraper selected such a page and thus returned incomplete evidence (missing per-track ratings), causing `rankingConsolidated` to be incorrect or sparse.

Root cause
- Scraper selection relied on suggest/title token matches without reliably verifying the artist or page content. Additionally, consolidation used strict normalization which failed to match many BestEver track title variants (punctuation, part labels), leaving valid mentions unmatched.

Fixes applied
- Scraper (`server/lib/scrapers/besteveralbums.js`):
  - Added a safe "fast-accept" path when `suggest.php` returns a title matching the pattern "<Album> by <Artist>" and the suggest title lacks bad keywords (e.g., `tribute`, `live`, `cover`, `deluxe`, `reissue`). The choice is logged via `bestever_fast_accept` for auditability.
  - Added page-content verification fallback: when suggest is ambiguous, the scraper fetches candidate pages and verifies album title/artist in the DOM before accepting the id.

- Consolidation (`server/lib/ranking.js` and `server/index.js`):
  - Hardened `normalizeKey` to strip diacritics (NFD + remove \p{M}), collapse non-alphanumerics, and preserve token boundaries.
  - Introduced tokenization and token-overlap heuristics and containment checks to match BestEver evidence to album tracks (reduced misses for variants such as "Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2").
  - Fixed mapping bug and ensured `finalPosition` from consolidated results is mapped deterministically back into `tracks[].rank` (server exports `tracksByAcclaim` sorted by rank for UI convenience).

- Frontend (`public/js/app.js`):
  - Updated collection and rendering logic to prefer server `tracksByAcclaim` for deterministic numbering while preserving ordering by `rating` (descending) when ratings are available. If ratings are absent, fallback to `rank` ordering.
  - Strengthened dedupe keys in `collectRankingAcclaim` to avoid discarding valid mentions.

Verification
- Local testing: reproduced problematic case for *The Wall* and confirmed scraper now selects canonical id (`a=204`) and returns per-track ratings; `rankingConsolidated` length matched track count and `tracks[].rank` was populated.
- Tests: server unit tests passed locally (`cd server && npm test`).

Notes / Next steps
- Consider adding an environment flag `BESTEVER_STRICT_VERIFY=true|false` to control fast-accept vs strict verification in high-throughput runs.
- Persist `rankingConsolidatedMeta` to Firestore for long-term auditability (currently returned inline in the payload).

---

## Patch: UI ordering / rating restoration (2025-11-25)

Summary
- Symptom: After the first UI hotfix that made the client use `tracksByAcclaim` for numbering, the visual ordering by `rating` was lost in some production views.
- Action: Updated `public/js/app.js` to enrich `tracksByAcclaim` with ratings (from `rankingConsolidated`, `bestEverEvidence`, or `rankingAcclaim`) and order the displayed list by `rating` when ratings exist, while continuing to show the deterministic `rank` number beside each track.

Verification
- Commit `ce78f9b` recorded the change; frontend was deployed to Firebase Hosting (`https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app`) using `./scripts/deploy-prod.sh` and verified with sample album payloads.

---

## Unreleased / Pending

- Persist `rankingConsolidatedMeta` to Firestore for long-term divergence auditing.
- Add optional env flag `BESTEVER_STRICT_VERIFY` to toggle scraper fast-accept behavior for batch vs strict runs.
- Add additional automated post-deploy smoke tests that call `/api/generate` for a set of known albums and assert `tracksByAcclaim` presence and congruence with BestEver evidence.

---

## Patch: Curation ordering fix (2025-11-25)

Summary
- Symptom: playlist generation was still effectively using the canonical `track.rank` (server-provided finalPosition) rather than the intended acclaim ordering (rating-desc) when selecting P1/P2 and filling playlists.

Root cause
- Although the UI and server provided `tracksByAcclaim` and visual ranks, the curation algorithm earlier relied on `track.rank` lookups which could reflect canonical positions. This produced playlists ordered by canonical rank rather than by acclaim rating.

Fix applied
- Updated `public/js/curation.js` to explicitly compute an acclaim-ordered per-album track list (prefer `rating` desc; fallback to existing rank/original order) and to:
  - Select P1/P2 from the acclaim-ordered list (top 2 tracks by rating),
  - Populate the `remaining` pool from the acclaim-ordered list (preserving the acclaim ordering),
  - Assign visual `rank` (1..N) on the working copy so downstream steps use the acclaim ordering.

Verification
- Commit `c501535` contains the fix. The change was pushed to `main`. Recommend running the following smoke test after deploy:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://<BACKEND_URL>/api/generate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"albumQuery":"Exile on Main St."}' | jq '.data.tracksByAcclaim[0:3], .data.rankingConsolidated[0:3]'
```

Notes
- This aligns generation behavior with the UI expectation: playlists are now built from acclaim ordering (rating), while the UI still surfaces canonical rank as an audit badge.

# MJRP Albums Balanced Playlists — Project Summary

**Version**: v2.12.0 (Production Stable)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-23

> **See Also**: [Product Vision](MJRP_PRODUCT_VISION.md) | [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md)

---

## Executive Summary

The MJRP Playlist Generator, **"The Album Blender"**, is a strategic curation platform designed to restore the depth of music appreciation. It operates as an intelligence layer above streaming services, blending raw data (Albums, Critical Acclaim, Popularity) into coherent, balanced, and personalized listening experiences.

**Key Pillars (v3.0 Vision)**:
1.  **Album-Centric Core**: The Album is the fundamental unit, but users can access it via Artists or Genres.
2.  **The Blending Menu**: Users select "Mix Styles" (e.g., "Deep Cuts", "Balanced Flow") instead of complex algorithms.
3.  **Responsive Intelligence**: A componentized architecture that adapts the experience to Desktop (Power User) and Mobile (Consumption).

### Current Status ✅ Production Stable
- **v2.12.0** (Sprint 12: Critical Fixes & AlbumsView Modularization)
- **v3.0.0-beta** (Sprint 15: SafeDOM & Component Architecture)
- Frontend: `https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app`
- Backend API: Cloud Run (`mjrp-proxy`)
- Core features operational

> [!NOTE]
> **Current Sprint (Sprint 17 - Modularization Complete)**:
> - 🟢 **Sprint 17 Complete**: Succesfully modularized `MusicKitService`, Refactored `SeriesView` to Passive View, and Implemented Variable Top N Strategy.
> - 🎯 **Goal**: Complete architectural modularization validation and cleanup.
> - 🟢 **Sprint 16 Complete**: Cleanup & Integrity (SafeDOM & Export Fixes).
> - 🟢 **Sprint 15 Complete**: SafeDOM Architecture.

> [!TIP]
> **Previous**: Sprint 15 delivered SafeDOM architecture, reducing XSS risks and standardizing UI components (`Card.js`, `TrackRow.js`).

## Deployment

### Production Environment

| Component | Platform | URL |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Frontend | Firebase Hosting | `https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app` |
| Backend | Cloud Run (southamerica-east1) | `https://mjrp-proxy-540062660076.southamerica-east1.run.app` |
| Database | Firestore | `mjrp-playlist-generator` project |

### Deployment Scripts

```bash
# Frontend
./scripts/deploy-prod.sh    # Deploys to Firebase Hosting

# Backend
./scripts/deploy-backend.sh # Builds + deploys to Cloud Run
```

**Backend Deployment Flow**:
1. Copy `shared/` → `server/_shared_temp/` (with ESM config)
2. Copy `config/` → `server/config/`
3. Build Docker image from `server/Dockerfile`
4. Deploy to Cloud Run with `gcloud run deploy`
5. Cleanup temporary directories

---

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`)

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd server
npm ci

# Create .env
cat > .env << EOL
AI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
PORT=3000
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8000
NODE_ENV=development
EOL

npm start  # Starts on :3000
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Serve static files
python3 -m http.server 8000 -d public

# Or use Firebase emulators
firebase serve --only hosting
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/hybrid-curator.html`

### Running Tests
```bash
# Backend unit tests
cd server && npm test

# Run specific test
npm test -- server/test/normalize.test.js
```

---

## v1.6.1 Recent Fixes (2025-11-26)

### Production Deployment Hotfix
**Problem**: Track ratings missing in production despite working locally

**Root Cause**:
1. `config/prompts.json` not copied to Cloud Run container
2. `shared/normalize.js` import path incorrect in container
3. Missing ESM configuration for shared module

**Solution**:
- Updated `scripts/deploy-backend.sh` to stage config/shared
- Modified `server/lib/prompts.js` to support multiple config paths
- Injected `{"type": "module"}` into shared module during deploy
- Added cache busting to frontend (`?v=1.6.0`)

**Verification**:
```bash
curl https://mjrp-proxy-540062660076.southamerica-east1.run.app/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"albumQuery": "Rolling Stones - Let it Bleed"}'

# Result: ✅ Has Ratings: true (was false)
```

**Debug Instrumentation Added**:
- `/api/debug/files` - Inspect container filesystem
- `/api/debug/import` - Test module imports
- `/api/debug/raw-ranking` - Scraper evidence inspection
- `debugTrace` in `fetchRankingForAlbum` - Execution flow tracking

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/deploy-backend.sh`
- `server/lib/prompts.js`
- `server/lib/fetchRanking.js`
- `server/index.js`
- `public/hybrid-curator.html`

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#v161-hotfix-production-deployment-2025-11-26) for details.

## v2.0 Roadmap (Planning Phase)

### Vision
Transform from single-page tool into **multi-section SPA** with series management.

### Key Features (Planned)

#### 1. Navigation & Routing
- **HashRouter**: States for `#home`, `#albums`, `#ranking`, `#playlists`
- **Lazy loading**: Dynamic imports per view
- **Shared layout**: TopNav component across all views

#### 2. Series Management
- **Home screen**: Create/manage playlist series
- **Firestore schema**: `series` collection with `albumQueries`, `createdAt`, `notes`
- **Historical series**: Resume previous curation sessions

#### 3. Album Library
- **View saved albums**: List with filters (artist, year, BestEver status)
- **Quick actions**: Remove, reprocess ranking, open BestEver reference
- **Sync badges**: Visual indicators for Firestore sync status

#### 4. Enhanced Ranking View
- **Tabs**: Summary, Sources, Logs (telemetry)
- **Per-album controls**: Update ranking, view debug trace
- **Source attribution**: Deduplicated list of ranking providers

#### 5. Playlist Versioning
- **Snapshots**: Save playlist state to `series/{id}/history/{timestamp}`
- **Revert capability**: Rollback to previous versions
- **Status badges**: "Drag applied", "Synchronized"

### Technical Improvements

#### Architecture Changes
```
public/js/
├── stores/          # NEW: State management
│   ├── albums.js
│   ├── playlists.js
│   └── series.js
├── views/           # NEW: Route views
│   ├── home.js
│   ├── albums.js
│   ├── ranking.js
│   └── playlists.js
├── components/      # NEW: Reusable components
│   └── topNav.js
└── app.js          # Refactored: Router + orchestrator
```

#### Tooling Upgrades
- **Bundler**: Vite (development server + optimized builds)
- **Testing**: Vitest + jsdom for headless UI tests
- **Build**: ES modules with tree-shaking

### Technical Decisions (v2.0)

#### Why Vite over Rollup?
**Decision**: Use Vite as bundler for v2.0

**Reasoning**:
- ✅ **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Native dev server with instant updates
- ✅ **Build Speed**: Uses esbuild (10-100x faster than traditional bundlers)
- ✅ **Minimal Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box for most use cases
- ✅ **Firebase Hosting Compatible**: Serves static builds seamlessly
- ✅ **Tree Shaking**: Excellent bundle optimization

**Alternative Considered**: Rollup
- ❌ Requires manual dev server configuration
- 🟡 Slower build times
- 🟡 Higher learning curve

**Result**: Vite adopted in Sprint 1

#### Risk Analysis

**Critical Risks Identified**:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Firestore Migration Data Loss** | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 High | Backup + staging + rollback plan |
| **Performance with Many Albums** | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium | Client-side filtering → server queries |
| **BestEverAlbums Rate Limiting** | 🟢 Low | 🟡 Medium | Queue + retry logic + caching |
| **Breaking Changes v1.6 → v2.0** | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 High | Migration guide + v1.6 support period |

**All risks documented in Sprint planning with specific mitigations.**

### Firestore Migration Strategy

**Approach**: Lazy migration (on-demand)
- Users on first v2.0 login: localStorage → Firestore migration
- Backup created before migration
- Rollback capability if migration fails
- Migration script: `migrate-to-v2.js` (Node CLI)

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for complete sprint breakdown (Sprints 1-9).

## API Reference

### Main Endpoint: `/api/generate`

**Request**:
```json
POST /api/generate
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "albumQuery": "Pink Floyd - The Wall"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "album": {
    "title": "The Wall",
    "artist": "Pink Floyd",
    "year": 1979,
    "tracks": [...]
  },
  "rankingConsolidated": [
    {
      "trackTitle": "Comfortably Numb",
      "rating": 97,
      "rawScore": 18,
      "supporting": [...],
      "finalPosition": 1,
      "normalizedScore": 1
    }
  ],
  "rankingSources": [...],
  "bestEverEvidence": {...},
  "tracksByAcclaim": [...],  // Sorted by rating desc
  "rankingConsolidatedMeta": {
    "divergence": {...},
    "debugInfo": {...}
  }
}
```

### Debug Endpoints (Production)

**⚠️ Note**: Should be protected/disabled in production

- `GET /api/debug/files?path=/usr/src/app` - List container files
- `GET /api/debug/import?input=text` - Test normalize import
- `POST /api/debug/raw-ranking` - Raw BestEver scraper output

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests (`server/test/`)
```bash
cd server && npm test
```

**Coverage**:
- `normalize.test.js`: Schema validation
- `ranking.test.js`: Borda consolidation, fuzzy matching
- `besteveralbums.test.js`: Scraper parsing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Load album (via query)
- [ ] Verify ratings appear
- [ ] Generate playlists (P1, P2, DeepCuts)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop reordering
- [ ] Save to Firestore
- [ ] Load saved curation

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Single-session only**: No series management (v2.0 feature)
2. **Client-side state**: No persistence beyond Firestore snapshot
3. **No batch processing**: One album at a time
4. **Rate limiting**: BestEverAlbums scraper can fail under load

### Recent Achievements
- **Persistence Layer Complete**: Implemented robust Firestore integration for Series and Playlists using `artifacts/mjrp-albums/users/{uid}/curator` namespace to comply with security rules.
- **UI Enhancements**: 
    - Redesigned `SavedPlaylistsView` (Your Playlists Series) with modern cards, badges, and "Edit" flow.
    - Updated `SeriesView` and `PlaylistsView` for better UX.
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Resolved "Ghost Albums" (Sprint 5.1) and Permission Denied errors (Sprint 5.4).(v2.0)
### Future Improvements
- [ ] Add batch album processing
- [ ] Implement queue for scraper requests
- [ ] Add health check endpoint
- [ ] Disable/protect debug endpoints in prod
- [ ] Add E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress)

---

## Design Patterns

### Proxy Pattern
**Server hides API keys**: Client never sees `AI_API_KEY`

### Strategy Pattern
**Dynamic ranking sources**: Scraper → AI fallback

### Facade Pattern
**Simplified client API**: `/api/generate` abstracts complexity

### Adapter Pattern
**Standardized responses**: BestEver HTML → normalized JSON

---

## CI/CD

### GitHub Actions
**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/ci-firebase.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` → Deploy production
- Pull requests → Deploy preview

**Steps**:
1. Install dependencies (root + server)
2. Run linter + tests
3. Build frontend
4. Deploy via `firebase-tools`

**Secrets Required**:
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT`
- `FIREBASE_TOKEN` (or `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`)
- `AI_API_KEY` (for E2E tests)

---

## Environment Variables

### Backend (`server/.env`)
```bash
AI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key    # Required
AI_ENDPOINT=...                    # Optional (defaults to Gemini)
AI_MODEL=...                       # Optional (defaults to gemini-1.5-flash)
PORT=3000                          # Optional
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8000  # CORS
NODE_ENV=development|production
```

### Frontend (`public/config.js`)
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "...",
  authDomain: "mjrp-playlist-generator.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "mjrp-playlist-generator",
  // ...
};
```

# Architecture Analysis & Refactoring Plan ("The Album Blender")

## 1. Executive Summary
The codebase is a **Vanilla JS Single Page Application (SPA)** using a custom Router and Observer Pattern for state management. 
While functional and "lightweight" (no framework overhead), it suffers from **"God Class" antipatterns** in Views and **Mixed Concerns** in Stores.

The recent introduction of the **Strategy Pattern** (Sprint 7.5) for View Modes is a step in the right direction, but broader structural changes are needed to maintain velocity.

---

## 2. Key Issues Identified

### 🔴 A. "God View" Monoliths (`AlbumsView.js`)
`AlbumsView.js` (~1500 lines) violates the Single Responsibility Principle. It handles:
1.  **Layout**: Rendering the full page structure.
2.  **Components**: Configuring grids, lists, cards, and headers manually (String concatenation).
3.  **Event Delegation**: Handling clicks, propagation, and filtering globally.
4.  **Business Logic**: "Ghost Album" prevention, scope resolution (Single vs All), and complex filtering.

**Impact**: High cognitive load, difficult to test, high risk of regressions when changing one part (e.g., Sprint 7.5 refactor needed careful surgery).

### 🔴 B. Stores Mixed with Persistence
`AlbumsStore.js` integrates **State Management** (active series, loading state) directly with **Data Access** (Firestore calls, JSON serialization).
- *Problem*: You cannot easily switch storage backends or test the store logic without mocking Firebase.
- *Problem*: Serialization logic (`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify)`) is likely duplicated across stores.
- *Inconsistent State*: A comprehensive "Repository Pattern" implementation **already exists** (`AlbumRepository.js`, `BaseRepository.js`) but is **completely unused** by `AlbumsStore`, which continues to use direct Firestore calls. This indicates a stalled migration/refactor.

### 🟡 C. Hardcoded Dependencies & Singletons
Views import stores directly:
```javascript
import { albumsStore } from '../stores/albums.js'
```
This tight coupling makes it impossible to unit test a View with a "Mock Store".

### 🟢 D. Good Parts
- **Robust Backend (BFF)**: The `server/` directory implements a solid Backend-for-Frontend pattern using Express. It correctly handles AI proxying (`aiClient.js`), validation (`schema.js`), and Apple Music tokens (`musickit.js`), keeping sensitive keys and logic secure.
- **Existing Foundations**: Reusable UI components (`components/`) and Data Repositories (`repositories/`) exist, providing a great head-start for refactoring.
- **MusicKitService**: Cleanly encapsulated domain logic. Zero UI coupling.
- **Strategy Pattern (ViewMode)**: Excellent use of patterns to handle variability.
- **Router**: Simple, effective History API wrapper.

---

## 3. Recommended Refactoring (Roadmap)

### Phase 1: Structural Separation (High Value, Low Risk)

#### 1. Adopt Existing Repositories (Complete the Migration)
The `AlbumRepository` class already exists and handles Firestore interactions cleanly.
**Action**:
- Inject `AlbumRepository` into `AlbumsStore`.
- Remove direct Firestore/Firebase imports from `AlbumsStore`.
- Switch `load` and `save` calls to use the repository methods.

```javascript
// stores/AlbumsStore.js
async loadAlbums() {
    this.items = await this.repository.load(this.activeSeriesId)
    this.notify()
}
```

#### 2. Componentization of `AlbumsView`
Break the monolith into functional components. Even without React, we can have classes that return HTML strings or DOM elements.

*   `components/AlbumCard.js` (Encapsulate the card HTML/badges)
*   `components/FilterBar.js` (Encapsulate the complex filter dropdowns/logic)
*   `components/SeriesGroup.js` (The "All Series" grouping logic)

### Phase 2: Design Patterns to Adopt

#### 1. Composite Operations (Command Pattern)
For complex operations like "Generate Playlists" which touch multiple stores and APIs.
- Create `commands/GeneratePlaylistsCommand.js`
- Encapsulate the logic currently sitting in `PlaylistsView`.

#### 2. Dependency Injection (Lite)
Instead of importing instances, pass dependencies in constructors.
```javascript
// app.js
const albumsRepo = new AlbumsRepository(db)
const albumsStore = new AlbumsStore(albumsRepo)
const albumsView = new AlbumsView(albumsStore) // Inject store
```

### Phase 3: Architectural "North Star"

Consider moving to a lightweight component library if the UI complexity grows. 
Since you successfully use **Web Components** (Standard) principles, you might benefit from **Lit** (just the library, not a framework shift) to handle the HTML rendering/updating more efficiently than raw Template Literals.

---

## 4. Immediate Action Item (Sprint 7.5/8)

**Refactor `filterAlbums` logic out of `AlbumsView`**:
Create a `SeriesFilteringService` or `AlbumFilter` utility. The view should just say:
`const visibleAlbums = AlbumFilter.apply(albums, this.filters)`
This removes ~100 lines of complex logic from the View.

## Design Patterns & Core Strategies

The application is built on a modular architecture using standard design patterns to ensure scalability and maintainability.

### 1. Strategy Pattern
Used for interchangeable behaviors:
- **ViewMode Strategy**: Decouples rendering (Compact vs Expanded) from view logic.
- **Algorithm Strategy**: Pluggable playlist generation algorithms (Cascade, S-Draft, etc.).

### 2. Repository Pattern
Abstracts Firestore interactions. All data access is centralized in `*Repository` classes, ensuring consistent schema handling and CRUD operations.

### 3. Observer Pattern
The core of state management. Stores notify registered views of changes, allowing for a reactive UI without a heavy framework like React.

### 4. Key Patterns Summary

| Pattern | Location | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Dependency Injection** | Server Routes / View Renderers | Injecting services or context objects into handlers |
| **State Machine** | `PlaylistsStore.mode` | Managing CREATE vs EDIT workflow states |
| **Barrel Export** | `views/*/index.js` | Single entry point for cleaner module imports |
| **Facade** | `MusicKitService.js` / `SpotifyService.js` | Simplified interfaces for complex external APIs |

---

## Router & View Lifecycle

The application uses a custom client-side router based on the History API (`pushState`). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Detailed sequence diagrams and lifecycle method definitions are documented in [data_flow_architecture.md](technical/data_flow_architecture.md#view-lifecycle--navigation).

### Registered Routes

| Path | View | Query Params |
|------|------|--------------|
| `/home` | HomeView | - |
| `/albums` | AlbumsView | `?seriesId=X` |
| `/playlists` | PlaylistsView | - |
| `/playlist-series` | SavedPlaylistsView | - |
| `/save-all` | SaveAllView | - |
| `/ranking/:albumId` | RankingView | - |
| `/ranking/consolidated` | ConsolidatedRankingView | - |
| `/inventory` | InventoryView | - |

---

## Domain Model Architecture

We use ES6 classes to encapsulate business logic and data integrity:

- **`Album`**: The central entity. Manages track orderings (Original, Balanced, Acclaim) and Spotify popularity data.
- **`Track`**: Value object ensuring metadata consistency (Artist, Album, Rank, Score).
- **`Playlist`**: Grouping of tracks with specific sequence and duration logic.
- **`Series`**: The curation context (e.g., "The Black Crowes - Essential Mix").

---

## Store State Management

Stores manage the application's runtime state and synchronization with Firestore.

- **Persistence**: Hybrid approach using Memory (L1) -> IndexedDB/Local (L2) -> Firestore (Remote).
- **TTL**: Cache entries for external API data (BestEver, Spotify) have a 7-day expiration.
- **Isolation**: All operations are scoped to `auth.currentUser.uid`.

---

## UI/UX Standards

### Iconography
- **Rule**: **Do NOT use Emojis for UI icons.**
- **Standard**: Use SVG icons from the centralized `Icons.js` registry. This ensures consistent rendering across platforms and CSS-based styling.

### Design Tokens
- **Typography**: Syne (Headers) / Inter (Body).
- **Theme**: Premium Dark (Flame/Amber accents).
- **Components**: Glassmorphism based cards with subtle hover effects.

---

## Firebase Integration Guide

- **SDK Version**: v11.6.1 (Modular).
- **Authentication**: Google & Apple OAuth via Firebase Auth.
- **Security**: Granular Firestore rules ensuring users can only read/write their own `curator` and `inventory` documents.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always deep-serialize objects (JSON) before sending to Firestore to remove class instances and `undefined` values that would cause SDK errors.

---

## Caching & Performance

- **Level 1 (Memory)**: Instant access during the active session.
- **Level 2 (In-Browser)**: Persistent cache for album metadata.
- **Strategy**: Stale-While-Revalidate pattern used for external metadata to ensure snappy transitions.

## Store-by-Store Analysis

### 1. AlbumSeriesStore
| Aspect | Implementation | Issue? |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Memory** | `this.series = []` | ✅ OK |
| **localStorage** | `mjrp_series` | ✅ OK |
| **Firestore** | `getSeriesCollectionPath()` | ⚠️ Just fixed |
| **Load** | `loadFromLocalStorage()` on constructor | ✅ OK |
| **Save** | `saveToLocalStorage()` + `saveToFirestore()` | ⚠️ Order was wrong |
| **Delete** | `deleteSeries()` | ⚠️ Just fixed |

**UPDATE/DELETE Flow:**
```
1. Firestore (source of truth) ← FIRST
2. Memory (this.series)
3. localStorage ← CACHE
4. notify()
```

---

### 2. AlbumsStore
| Aspect | Implementation | Issue? |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Memory** | `albumsByAlbumSeriesId = Map<string, Album[]>` | ✅ Per-series keying |
| **localStorage** | ❌ NOT USED | Could restore Ghost Albums |
| **Firestore** | `saveToFirestore()` → `/albums/{id}` | 🔴 Wrong path! |
| **Load** | From API via `fetchAlbum()` | ✅ OK |
| **Save** | Only via EditAlbumModal | ⚠️ Missing serialization |
| **Delete** | `removeAlbum()` | 🔴 Only in-memory! |

**CRITICAL ISSUE:**
- Albums are NOT persisted to Firestore consistently
- `removeAlbum()` only removes from memory → comes back on reload
- Path `/albums/{id}` doesn't match security rules

---

### 3. PlaylistsStore
| Aspect | Implementation | Issue? |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Memory** | `this.playlists = []` | ✅ OK |
| **localStorage** | `mjrp_current_playlists` | ✅ OK |
| **Firestore** | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | 🔴 Missing! |
| **Load** | `loadFromLocalStorage()` | ✅ OK |
| **Save** | `saveToLocalStorage()` | ⚠️ No Firestore |
| **Delete** | Not implemented | - |

**ISSUE:** Playlists don't persist to Firestore → lost on different device

---

### 4. InventoryStore (via Repository)
| Aspect | Implementation | Issue? |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Memory** | `this.albums = []` | ✅ OK |
| **Cache** | CacheManager (L1+L2) | ✅ OK |
| **Firestore** | via InventoryRepository | ✅ Correct pattern |
| **Load** | `repository.findAll()` | ✅ OK |
| **Save** | `repository.addAlbum()` | ✅ With serialization |
| **Delete** | `repository.removeAlbum()` | ✅ Firestore first |

**This is the CORRECT pattern** - other stores should follow it.

    subgraph "When to CLEAR Cache"
        A[Change Series] --> ClearAlbums[AlbumsStore.reset]
        B[Delete Entity] --> InvalidateCache[cacheManager.invalidate]

    end
    
    subgraph "When to KEEP Cache"
        D[Navigation] --> Keep[DO NOT clear]
        E[View Lifecycle] --> Keep
        F[Tab Switch] --> Keep
    end
```

---

## Identified Gaps (Root Cause of Bugs)

### Gap 1: Inconsistent Persistence Patterns
| Store | Pattern | Should Be |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| AlbumSeriesStore | Mixed (localStorage + Firestore) | Repository Pattern |
| AlbumsStore | API only, no persistence | Repository Pattern |
| PlaylistsStore | localStorage only | Repository Pattern |
| InventoryStore | ✅ Repository Pattern | ✅ Correct |

### Gap 2: Missing Firestore Paths
| Store | Current Path | Correct Path |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| AlbumSeriesStore | `/series/{id}` | ✅ Fixed: `getSeriesCollectionPath()` |
| AlbumsStore | `/albums/{id}` | ❌ Should be: `/artifacts/mjrp-albums/users/{userId}/curator/albums` |
| PlaylistsStore | ❌ None | Should be: `/artifacts/mjrp-albums/users/{userId}/curator/playlists` |

### Gap 3: Delete Not Reaching Firestore
| Entity | Memory Delete | localStorage Delete | Firestore Delete |
|--------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Series | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Just fixed |
| Album in Series | ✅ | ❌ No persistence | ❌ No persistence |
| Playlist | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ Not implemented |
| Inventory Album | ✅ | ✅ (cache) | ✅ via Repository |

## Action Items

1. ⏳ **AlbumsStore** - Create `AlbumRepository` following InventoryRepository pattern
2. ⏳ **PlaylistsStore** - Create `PlaylistRepository` (code exists, needs integration)
3. ⏳ **AlbumSeriesStore** - Refactor to use `SeriesRepository` (code exists, needs integration)
4. ⏳ **All Stores** - Ensure JSON serialization before Firestore writes
5. ⏳ **All Deletes** - Firestore first, then memory/localStorage

## 🔴 Priority Matrix (The "Top 5 Fixes")

| File Path | Lines | Score | Main Violation | Actionable Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `public/js/views/AlbumsView.js` | 1,220 | 🟠 4 | God Class, complex DOM strings | Extract `AlbumCard` and `FilterBar` as Components. |
| `public/js/views/PlaylistsView.js` | 753 | 🟠 4 | Mixed responsibilities (UI + Drag Logic) | Migrate drag logic into `PlaylistsDragBoard` Component. |
| `public/js/views/InventoryView.js` | 742 | 🟠 4 | Monolithic grid rendering | Implement `InventoryGrid` component. |
| `public/js/views/HomeView.js` | 659 | 🟠 4 | Mixed search and landing logic | Extract `SearchModule` into a shared component. |
| `All Components/Views` | - | 🔴 2 | Security (innerHTML) | Replace `innerHTML` with `textContent` or use `template` tag. |

---

## 🧩 Domain Analysis

### A. Frontend Componentization (UI focused)
- **Status**: Transitioning from monoliths to fragments.
- **Wins**: New `InventoryGrid.js` and `PlaylistsDragBoard.js` placeholders created.
- **Risks**: View files are still responsible for heavy HTML string building, leading to the 1,000+ line counts. Use of `escapeHtml` in `BaseView` is good, but `innerHTML` remains the default sink.

### B. Logic Modularization (Logic/Backend)
- **Status**: Strong separation.
- **Wins**: Logic-to-View ratio of 1.41 shows that business rules are successfully living in Repositories, Stores, and Controllers. 96% of these modules are pure logic (testable in Node/CI).
- **Risks**: High dependency surface in `curation.js` and `AlbumsView.js`.

### C. Performance & Security
- **Performance**: High DOM overhead due to full view re-renders. Partial updates using `update()` are rarely used.
- **Security**: **Critical usage of `innerHTML`** across 39 files. Any malicious data in Spotify or BestEverAlbums APIs could lead to XSS.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate (Sprint 13)
1.  **Stop using `innerHTML`**: Mandate `textContent` for all dynamic data injection.
2.  **Extract `AlbumCard.js`**: This is the single highest leverage move to reduce `AlbumsView.js` and `InventoryView.js`.
3.  **Implement Partial Updates**: Update `BaseView.update()` to target specific elements rather than full container refreshes.

### Architectural (Long-term)
1.  **Shared Component Library**: Increase reusability by moving common UI patterns (Cards, Modals, Toasts) into the dedicated `shared/` folder.
2.  **Move to Virtual DOM / Reactive Templates**: If complexity continues to grow, consider a small reactive library or a custom `template` engine to replace manual string building.

# Post-Deploy Audit Report

**Date**: 2025-12-10  
**Auditor**: AI Developer Experience (Gemini)  
**Scope**: Documentation audit after v2.1.0 production deployment  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## Executive Summary

This audit verified that all documentation aligns with the current codebase after the Sprint 5 production deployment (v2.1.0). All critical documents were reviewed, Sprint 5 UAT was closed and archived, and the DEBUG_LOG was indexed.

---

## 1️⃣ Commit-Changelog Mapping

✅ **Complete** - Inserted mapping table into `CHANGELOG.md` covering the last 20 commits including:
- Tags: `v2.1.0-ready-for-prod-20251209`, `v2.1.0-beta.1-20251209`
- Critical fixes: Issues #30-#34 (Album CRUD, Playlists API, Axios, Cloud Build)

---

## 2️⃣ Code-Documentation Consistency

### Authentication Flow (app.js vs ARCHITECTURE.md)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Primary auth method documented | ✅ Firebase Anonymous Auth |
| SDK version matches | ✅ v11.6.1 in both |
| `onAuthStateChanged` listener | ✅ Correctly documented |
| Tech debt (`'anonymous-user'` fallback) | ⚠️ **Documented but not fixed** |

**Finding**: 13 occurrences of `|| 'anonymous-user'` fallback remain in code across 10 files. The documentation correctly identifies this as tech debt (ARCHITECTURE.md lines 668-671).

**Files with fallback**:
- `MigrationUtility.js:150`
- `SavedPlaylistsView.js:232,369`
- `PlaylistsView.js:318`
- `albumSeries.js:35,45`
- `AlbumRepository.js:18`
- `SeriesRepository.js:18`
- `PlaylistRepository.js:18`
- `InventoryRepository.js:17`
- `inventory.js:35`
- `playlists.js:288,336`

**Recommendation**: Schedule removal for Sprint 7 (OAuth implementation).

---

## 3️⃣ Log Organization

## Executive Summary

**UAT Result**: ❌ **FAILED - Multiple Critical Blockers**

### Critical Issues Found

1. 🔴 **P0**: Firebase SDK Mismatch - **Nothing saved to Firestore** - ❌ UNRESOLVED
2. 🔴 **P0**: Series Management UI - **All buttons non-functional** - ❌ UNRESOLVED
3. 🔴 **P0**: Ghost Albums (Expanded View) - ❌ UNRESOLVED (4 fix attempts failed - see DEBUG_LOG.md Issue #22)

---

## Test Execution Results

### Phase 1: Series Management UI ⛔ BLOCKED - ❌ UNRESOLVED

**Test Cases**:
- ✅ **TC-01a**: Access `/series` view via Top Nav → **PASS**
- ❌ **TC-01b**: Edit Series (Rename) → **BLOCKED** (Button not working) - ❌ UNRESOLVED
- ❌ **TC-01c**: Delete Series (Safe Delete) → **BLOCKED** (Button not working) - ❌ UNRESOLVED
- ❌ **TC-01d**: Open Series (Navigation) → **BLOCKED** (Button not working) - ❌ UNRESOLVED

**Issue**: All action buttons (Edit, Open, Delete) on series cards are non-responsive.

**Evidence**:
![Series Management View](file:///Users/mpedroso/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7079f1cc-f610-478a-a72a-bb506cb58e18/series_management_view_1764813360785.png)

**Recording**: [series_management_crud_1764813325401.webp](file:///Users/mpedroso/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7079f1cc-f610-478a-a72a-bb506cb58e18/series_management_crud_1764813325401.webp)

**Root Cause (Hypothesis)**: Event listeners not properly attached in `SeriesListView.mount()`.

---

### Phase 2: Firestore Persistence 🔴 CRITICAL FAILURE - ❌ UNRESOLVED

**Test Objective**: Verify data is saved to Firestore (not just localStorage).

**Finding**: ❌ **NOTHING is being saved to Firestore** - ❌ UNRESOLVED

#### Affected Domains

| Domain | localStorage | Firestore | Status |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Albums** | ✅ Works | ❌ Never called | Cache-only - ❌ UNRESOLVED |
| **Series** | ✅ Works | ❌ **Runtime crash** | `firebase is not defined` - ❌ UNRESOLVED |
| **Playlists** | ✅ Works | ❌ **Runtime crash** | `firebase is not defined` - ❌ UNRESOLVED |

#### Root Cause: Firebase SDK Mismatch - ❌ UNRESOLVED

**Problem**: Code uses ES6 modular imports but expects compat SDK global.

```javascript
// app.js (Modular SDK)
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase-app.js'
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase-firestore.js'

// But code expects (Compat SDK global):
firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()  // ❌ ReferenceError
```

**Affected Files**:
- `stores/series.js:203` - `saveToFirestore()` crashes
- `repositories/BaseRepository.js:236` - `getServerTimestamp()` crashes

**Console Error**:
```
ReferenceError: firebase is not defined
    at SeriesStore.saveToFirestore (series.js:203)
    at HomeView.handleCreateSeries (HomeView.js:346)
```

#### Albums - Additional Issue - ❌ UNRESOLVED

Even if Firebase global existed, albums are never saved:

```javascript
// AlbumsView.js:949
albumsStore.addAlbum(result.album)  // ❌ Only calls saveToLocalStorage()
```

**Missing**: Integration with `AlbumRepository.create()`.

---

### Phase 3: Regression Testing

#### TC-Ghost-01: Ghost Albums in Expanded View ❌ UNRESOLVED

**Test Flow**:
1. Create Series A (2 albums)
2. Create Series B (2 albums)
3. View Series A in Expanded View
4. Switch to Series B
5. **Expected**: Only Series B albums visible
6. **Actual**: ❌ **FAIL** - Ghost albums still appearing

**Status**: ❌ UNRESOLVED - 4 fix attempts failed on 2025-12-06. See `docs/debug/DEBUG_LOG.md` Issue #22 for details.

**Failed Attempts**:
1. Closure Capture → FAILED
2. Revert to Original → FAILED
3. Guard in Subscription → FAILED
4. Timing Fix (setSeriesId before reset) → FAILED

**Evidence**: 
- [Initial reproduction](file:///Users/mpedroso/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7079f1cc-f610-478a-a72a-bb506cb58e18/prod_expanded_switch_to_b_1764802058857.png)

---

## Critical Blockers for Sprint 5 Sign-off

### Blocker #1: Firebase SDK Mismatch (P0) - ❌ UNRESOLVED

**Impact**: **All cloud persistence broken** - Data only in localStorage.

**Fix Options**:

**Option 1 (Recommended)**: Switch to Modular SDK
```javascript
// stores/series.js & BaseRepository.js
import { serverTimestamp } from 'firebase/firestore'

// Replace:
firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
// With:
serverTimestamp()
```

**Option 2**: Add Compat SDK
```javascript
// app.js
import firebase from 'firebase-compat-app.js'
import 'firebase-compat-firestore.js'

const app = firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
const db = app.firestore()
```

---

### Blocker #2: Series Management Buttons (P0) - ❌ UNRESOLVED

**Impact**: Cannot edit, delete, or open series from `/series` view.

**Reproduction**:
1. Navigate to `/series`
2. Click Edit/Open/Delete buttons
3. **Result**: No action occurs (no modal, no navigation, no errors)

**Hypothesis**: Event delegation selector not matching button elements in `SeriesListView.mount()`.

**Verification Needed**:
- Check `data-action` attributes on buttons
- Verify event listener attachment
- Test in DevTools console: `document.querySelector('[data-action="edit"]')`

---

### Blocker #3: Albums Not Saved to Firestore (P1) - ❌ UNRESOLVED

**Impact**: Albums lost on cache clear or device switch.

**Fix**:
```javascript
// AlbumsView.js:949 (loadAlbumsFromQueries callback)
if (result.status === 'success' && result.album) {
    albumsStore.addAlbum(result.album)
    
    // ADD: Save to Firestore (non-blocking)
    if (this.db && activeSeries) {
        albumsStore.saveToFirestore(this.db, result.album)
            .catch(err => console.warn('⚠️ Failed to save album:', err))
    }
}
```

---

### Blocker #4: Ghost Albums (P0) - ❌ UNRESOLVED

**Impact**: Albums from previous series appear when switching series.

**Status**: 4 fix attempts failed on 2025-12-06.

**See**: `docs/debug/DEBUG_LOG.md` Issue #22 for full investigation history.

---

## Test Cases Not Executed (Blocked)

Due to critical blockers, the following test scenarios could not be completed:

### Inventory Management (Deferred) - ❌ UNRESOLVED
- TC-019: Add Album to Inventory - ❌ UNRESOLVED
- TC-020: Filter by Format - ❌ UNRESOLVED
- TC-021: Search Inventory - ❌ UNRESOLVED
- TC-022: Create Series from Selection - ❌ UNRESOLVED
- TC-023: Edit Album Details - ❌ UNRESOLVED
- TC-024: Delete Album - ❌ UNRESOLVED

### Playlist Persistence (Blocked by SDK Issue)
- TC-02a: Generate playlists → ✅ UI works
- TC-02b: Verify localStorage → ✅ Works
- TC-02c: Verify Firestore → ❌ **BLOCKED** (SDK crash) - ❌ UNRESOLVED
- TC-02d: F5 Persistence → ⚠️ Works (from localStorage, not Firestore)

### Offline Resilience (Blocked) - ❌ UNRESOLVED
- TC-04a-d: Offline mode testing → **BLOCKED** (Firestore writes crash) - ❌ UNRESOLVED

---

## Recommendations for AI Developer

### Immediate Actions (P0)

1. **Fix Firebase SDK Mismatch** - ❌ UNRESOLVED
   - Choose modular SDK (recommended) or compat SDK
   - Update `series.js` and `BaseRepository.js`
   - Test with `console.log()` before Firestore calls
   - Verify no `firebase is not defined` errors

2. **Fix Series Management Buttons** - ❌ UNRESOLVED
   - Debug event listeners in `SeriesListView.mount()`
   - Verify `data-action` attributes in HTML
   - Test button clicks manually in production

3. **Integrate Albums Firestore Persistence** - ❌ UNRESOLVED
   - Add `saveToFirestore()` calls in `loadAlbumsFromQueries()`
   - Consider batch write after load completes
   - Handle errors gracefully (offline scenario)

4. **Fix Ghost Albums** - ❌ UNRESOLVED
   - Review DEBUG_LOG.md Issue #22 for failed attempts
   - Consider different approach (not tried yet)
   - Root cause still unknown

### Verification After Fixes

**For SDK Fix**:
```javascript
// Add temporary debug
console.log('[DEBUG] Attempting Firestore save...')
await playlistRepository.createMany(playlists)
console.log('[DEBUG] Firestore save successful')
```

**For Series Buttons**:
- Click Edit → Modal should open
- Click Delete → Confirmation modal should open
- Click Open → Navigate to `/albums?seriesId=...`

---

## Summary

**Blockers Found**: 4 Critical (P0/P1)  
**Tests Passed**: 3 (localStorage only - TC-01a, TC-02a, TC-02b)  
**Tests Blocked/Unresolved**: 15+ (due to SDK/button/ghost issues)  

**Sprint 5 Sign-off**: ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED** until blockers resolved.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Review DEBUG_LOG.md for Ghost Albums investigation history
2. Fix Firebase SDK mismatch first (enables all Firestore tests)
3. Debug Series button event listeners
4. Re-attempt Ghost Albums fix with fresh approach



# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\V2.0_DEPLOYMENT_IMPACT_pm_archived_20251208.md
--------------------------------------------------
# v2.0 Deployment - Mudanças e Impacto

**TL;DR**: ✅ **Backend sem mudanças, Frontend ganha apenas 1 build step**

---

## Comparação: v1.6.1 vs. v2.0

### Backend (Cloud Run)

#### ❌ O que NÃO muda

**Backend continua 100% igual**:
- ✅ Mesmo `server/Dockerfile`
- ✅ Mesmo `scripts/deploy-backend.sh`
- ✅ Mesmas variáveis de ambiente
- ✅ Mesmo processo de deploy

**Por quê?**  
Vite é **só para frontend**. Backend Node.js/Express continua exatamente como está.

```bash
# Deploy backend v2.0 (IDÊNTICO ao v1.6.1)
./scripts/deploy-backend.sh

# Nenhuma mudança necessária! 🎉
```

---

### Frontend (Firebase Hosting)

#### 🔄 O que MUDA

**Setup atual (v1.6.1)**:
```bash
# firebase.json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "public",  # Serve arquivos direto
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"]
  }
}

# Deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Setup novo (v2.0)**:
```bash
# firebase.json (ATUALIZADO)
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",  # ← MUDANÇA: serve build output
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"  # ← SPA routing
      }
    ]
  }
}

# Deploy (COM BUILD)
npm run build           # ← NOVO STEP
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Resumo da mudança**:
1. ➕ Adicionar `npm run build` antes do deploy
2. 🔄 Mudar `"public": "public"` → `"public": "dist"`
3. ➕ Adicionar `rewrites` para SPA routing

**Isso é tudo!** 

---

## Deploy Scripts Atualizados

### v1.6.1 (Atual)
```bash
# scripts/deploy-prod.sh (atual)
#!/bin/bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### v2.0 (Novo)
```bash
# scripts/deploy-prod.sh (atualizado - APENAS 1 LINHA NOVA)
#!/bin/bash

# Build frontend
npm run build  # ← ÚNICA LINHA NOVA

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Diferença**: Literalmente 1 linha (`npm run build`)

---

## Variáveis de Ambiente

### Backend (Cloud Run)

#### ❌ Sem mudanças

```bash
# v1.6.1 (atual)
AI_API_KEY=xxx
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app
NODE_ENV=production
AI_ENDPOINT=...
AI_MODEL=...

# v2.0 (IDÊNTICO)
AI_API_KEY=xxx
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app
NODE_ENV=production
AI_ENDPOINT=...
AI_MODEL=...
```

**Nenhuma variável nova necessária!**

---

### Frontend (Firebase Hosting)

#### ❌ Sem mudanças

```javascript
// public/config.js (v1.6.1 e v2.0 - IDÊNTICO)
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "xxx",
  authDomain: "mjrp-playlist-generator.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "mjrp-playlist-generator",
  storageBucket: "...",
  messagingSenderId: "...",
  appId: "..."
}
```

**Config continua hard-coded no arquivo (como antes)**

**Por quê não usar .env?**
- Frontend é público (build estático)
- Firebase config não é secreto (safe expor)
- Vite suporta `.env`, mas não é necessário aqui

---

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

### Workflow Atual (.github/workflows/ci-firebase.yml)

#### O que precisa mudar:

```diff
# .github/workflows/ci-firebase.yml

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      # Backend (SEM MUDANÇAS)
      - name: Install backend deps
        run: cd server && npm ci
      - name: Test backend
        run: cd server && npm test
      
+     # Frontend (NOVO BUILD STEP)
+     - name: Install frontend deps
+       run: npm ci
+     - name: Build frontend
+       run: npm run build
      
      # Deploy (SEM MUDANÇAS)
      - name: Deploy to Firebase
        run: firebase deploy --only hosting
        env:
          FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}
```

**Mudanças**:
1. ➕ `npm ci` (instalar Vite)
2. ➕ `npm run build` (build frontend)

**Secrets**: ZERO novos secrets necessários

---

## Configurações no Google Cloud Console

### Cloud Run (Backend)

#### ❌ ZERO mudanças

- Service name: `mjrp-proxy` (mesmo)
- Region: `southamerica-east1` (mesmo)
- Container port: `3000` (mesmo)
- Environment variables: (mesmas)
- IAM: (mesmo)
- CPU/Memory: (mesmo)

**Nenhuma configuração nova!**

---

### Firebase Hosting (Frontend)

#### 🔄 Mudanças mínimas

**No console Firebase** (apenas 1 vez):

Nenhuma configuração manual necessária! `firebase.json` define tudo.

**Opcionalmente** (se quiser):
- Performance Monitoring: Continua funcionando
- Analytics: Continua funcionando
- Hosting headers: Pode adicionar cache headers para `/dist/assets/*`

---

## Migração Passo a Passo

### Fase 1: Desenvolvimento (feature branch)

```bash
# Já em feature/v2.0-foundation
npm install  # Instala Vite
npm run dev  # Testa localmente

# Backend continua rodando separado
cd server && npm start
```

**Impacto**: ZERO - Só no seu computador

---

### Fase 2: Staging/Preview

```bash
# Build local
npm run build

# Preview local
npm run preview
# OU
firebase serve --only hosting

# Testa se funciona
```

**Impacto**: ZERO - Só preview local

---

### Fase 3: Deploy Produção

```bash
# 1. Atualizar firebase.json (1x apenas)
# 2. Atualizar scripts/deploy-prod.sh (adicionar npm run build)
# 3. Deploy
./scripts/deploy-prod.sh
```

**Impacto**: 
- ✅ Firebase Hosting continua servindo
- ✅ URL continua a mesma
- ✅ Backend não afetado
- ✅ Rollback fácil (reverter deploy)

---

## Rollback Plan

Se v2.0 quebrar algo:

### Opção 1: Rollback Firebase Hosting (30 segundos)

```bash
# Firebase Hosting guarda histórico de deploys
firebase hosting:channel:deploy previous

# OU no console Firebase:
# Hosting → Release History → "Rollback to this version"
```

**Tempo**: ~30 segundos  
**Impacto**: ZERO downtime

---

### Opção 2: Rollback Git (2 minutos)

```bash
# Volta para tag v1.6working-in-prod
git checkout v1.6working-in-prod

# Rebuild e deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Tempo**: ~2 minutos  
**Impacto**: Mínimo

---

## Comparação: Complexidade de Deploy

### Webpack/CRA (se você escolhesse)

```bash
# Muitas configs:
- webpack.config.js (200+ linhas)
- .babelrc
- webpack-dev-server config
- Proxy config separado
- Env vars complexas
- Build pode quebrar com updates

# Deploy:
npm run build  # 1-5 minutos
```

### Vite (minha recomendação)

```bash
# 1 arquivo config:
- vite.config.js (30 linhas)

# Deploy:
npm run build  # 10-30 segundos
```

**Vite é mais simples!**

---

## Custos

### v1.6.1 (Atual)

- Firebase Hosting: Spark Plan (grátis)
- Cloud Run: Pay-per-use (~$0-5/mês)

### v2.0 (Novo)

- Firebase Hosting: Spark Plan (grátis) ← **SEM MUDANÇA**
- Cloud Run: Pay-per-use (~$0-5/mês) ← **SEM MUDANÇA**

**Build CI** (GitHub Actions):
- Adiciona ~30s por deploy
- Dentro do free tier (2000 min/mês)

**Custo adicional**: $0

---

## Performance em Produção

### Bundle Size

**v1.6.1** (sem bundler):
```
public/js/app.js          ~80 KB
public/js/curation.js     ~40 KB
public/js/api.js          ~10 KB
Sortable.js               ~90 KB
Total:                    ~220 KB
```

**v2.0** (com Vite):
```
dist/assets/index-abc123.js    ~150 KB (minified + gzipped)
dist/assets/vendor-xyz789.js   ~60 KB  (Sortable separado)
Total:                         ~210 KB
```

**Melhoria**: ~10 KB menor + code splitting

---

### Loading Speed

**v1.6.1**:
- 6 requests HTTP separados
- Sem cache hash (pode servir versão velha)
- Sem minificação

**v2.0**:
- 2-3 requests (chunking inteligente)
- Hash no filename (cache perfeito)
- Minificado + tree-shaked

**Resultado**: ~20-30% mais rápido

---

## Checklist de Migration

### Pré-Deploy
- [ ] Testar `npm run build` localmente
- [ ] Testar `npm run preview` (serve dist/)
- [ ] Verificar todos os imports funcionando
- [ ] Backend respondendo corretamente

### Deploy
- [ ] Atualizar `firebase.json`
- [ ] Atualizar `scripts/deploy-prod.sh`
- [ ] Atualizar `.github/workflows/ci-firebase.yml` (se usar)
- [ ] `npm run build`
- [ ] `firebase deploy --only hosting`

### Pós-Deploy
- [ ] Testar produção (https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app)
- [ ] Verificar API calls funcionando
- [ ] Verificar console do browser (sem erros)
- [ ] Smoke test: Criar playlist

---

## Resposta Direta às Suas Perguntas

### 1. "O que mudará nos deployments?"

**Backend**: Nada  
**Frontend**: Adicionar 1 step (`npm run build`)

---

### 2. "Conseguirei fazer normalmente via Cloud Run?"

**Sim!** Cloud Run não muda nada. Deploy backend continua:
```bash
./scripts/deploy-backend.sh  # Exatamente como antes
```

---

### 3. "Terei que fazer muitas configurações novas no console?"

**Não!** 
- Cloud Run: ZERO configs novas
- Firebase Hosting: ZERO configs no console (tudo via `firebase.json`)

---

### 4. "E variáveis de ambiente?"

**Backend**: Mesmas variáveis  
**Frontend**: Mesmas configurações (hard-coded, não secret)

**ZERO variáveis novas!**

---

## Recomendação

### Migração Segura

1. **Desenvolver em branch** ✅ (já estamos em `feature/v2.0-foundation`)
2. **Testar localmente** (`npm run build` + `npm run preview`)
3. **Deploy staging** (Firebase Hosting preview channel)
4. **Deploy produção** (quando aprovado)
5. **Rollback pronto** (Firebase guarda histórico)

### Benefícios vs. Complexidade

**Benefícios**:
- ⚡ Dev experience muito melhor (HMR)
- 📦 Bundle otimizado (menor, mais rápido)
- 🎯 Code splitting automático
- 🔍 Source maps para debug

**Complexidade adicionada**:
- ➕ 1 linha no script de deploy
- ➕ 1 arquivo de config (vite.config.js)
- ➕ npm install Vite (1x)

**Trade-off**: Vale muito a pena! 🚀

---

## Conclusão

**Deployment v2.0 é**:
- ✅ **Simples**: Apenas 1 build step novo
- ✅ **Seguro**: Rollback fácil
- ✅ **Sem custos**: $0 adicional
- ✅ **Sem configs**: ZERO variáveis novas
- ✅ **Backend inalterado**: Cloud Run continua igual

**Você pode começar tranquilo!** 

Alguma dúvida específica sobre deploy que ficou? Posso criar um script de deploy de teste para você ver antes de aprovar?

# Local run instructions

Quick steps to start the proxy server and the static UI locally (zsh / macOS).

Prerequisites
- Node.js and `npm` installed
- Python 3 installed (for quick static server) or `npx serve` if preferred
- If you want the AI endpoint to work, create a `.env` inside `server/` with `AI_API_KEY=...` (or set equivalent env vars)

Start both services (one command)
```bash
# from repo root
./scripts/start-local.sh
```

What the script does
- runs `npm ci` in `server/`
- starts `npm start` in `server/` and saves logs to `.local_logs/server.log`
- starts a Python `http.server` serving `public/` on port `8000` and logs to `.local_logs/public.log`
- records PIDs in `.local_pids` so you can stop them later

Stop services
```bash
./scripts/stop-local.sh
```

Useful one-liners
- Health check
```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:3000/_health | jq
```
- Smoke POST to `/api/generate`
```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"albumQuery":"Radiohead - OK Computer"}' | jq
```
- Tail server logs
```bash
tail -f .local_logs/server.log
```

Troubleshooting
- If you see 503 from `/api/generate`, ensure `AI_API_KEY` is set in `server/.env` or environment.
- If the UI can't reach the proxy due to CORS, check `server/index.js` for `cors()` configuration allowing `http://localhost:8000`.
- If `npm ci` fails due to node version mismatch, use `nvm` to switch to a compatible Node version (workflow uses Node 18.x).

Notes
- These scripts only start local processes — they do not modify source files or deploy anything.
- You can replace the Python static server with any static server you prefer.

# Port Configuration Reference

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-06  
**Purpose**: Definitive guide to prevent port confusion

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: This Project Does NOT Use Port 5173

> [!CAUTION]
> **Port 5173 is the Vite default but is NOT configured in this project**.
> Always use the ports documented below.

---

## Port Configuration

| Port | Purpose | Configuration | npm Command |
|------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **5000** | Dev Server (Primary) | `vite.config.js:30` | `npm run dev` |
| **5005** | Preview Server (E2E Tests) | `test/e2e/helpers.js:6` | `npm run preview` |
| **3000** | Backend API Proxy | `server/index.js` | `cd server && node index.js` |

---

## Why Not 5173?

**5173 is Vite's default port** when no configuration exists. This project explicitly sets port **5000** in `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
// vite.config.js line 29-30
server: {
    port: 5000,  // ← Explicitly set, NOT 5173
```

**If you see 5173**, something is wrong:
1. ❌ `vite.config.js` is not being read
2. ❌ Running Vite from wrong directory
3. ❌ Configuration syntax error

---

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend API
cd server && node index.js
# → API available at http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2: Frontend Dev Server
npm run dev
# → App available at http://localhost:5000
```

### E2E Testing
```bash
# Terminal 1: Preview Server (production-like build)
npm run preview
# → App available at http://localhost:5005

# Terminal 2: Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
# → Tests connect to localhost:5005
```

---

## Verification

**Check current dev server port**:
```bash
grep -n "port:" vite.config.js
# Expected output: "30:        port: 5000,"
```

**Check E2E test port**:
```bash
grep "BASE_URL" test/e2e/helpers.js
# Expected output: "export const BASE_URL = process.env.BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:5005';"
```

---

## References in Documentation

All documentation uses the correct ports:

| File | Line | Port |
|------|------|------|
| docs/README.md | 21 | 5000 (dev) |
| docs/onboarding/DEVELOPER.md | 189 | 5000 |
| docs/onboarding/DEVOPS.md | 29 | 5000 |
| docs/onboarding/QA_ENGINEER.md | 47 | 5000 (dev), 5005 (preview) |
| test/e2e/helpers.js | 6 | 5005 (E2E) |

**Verified**: No references to port 5173 exist in codebase or docs ✅

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I'm getting 404 on localhost:5173"

**Problem**: You're using the wrong port.  
**Solution**: Use **http://localhost:5000** instead.

### "npm run dev starts on random port"

**Problem**: Port 5000 is already in use.  
**Solution**:
```bash
# Find what's using port 5000
lsof -i :5000

# Kill the process or stop the conflicting service
```

### "E2E tests fail to connect"

**Problem**: Preview server not running or wrong port.  
**Solution**:
```bash
# Make sure preview is running on 5005
npm run preview

# Check it's accessible
curl http://localhost:5005
```

---

## For New AI Agents

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DO NOT assume port 5173**. This project uses:
> - Dev: **5000**
> - Preview/E2E: **5005**
> - API: **3000**

Always verify with:
```bash
npm run dev  # Opens on 5000, NOT 5173
```



# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\devops\SECRET_ROTATION_RUNBOOK_ARCHIVED_20251210.md
--------------------------------------------------
# Runbook: Rotação do segredo `AI_API_KEY`

Objetivo: fornecer passos claros e reproduzíveis para rotacionar a chave de API usada pelo proxy (`AI_API_KEY`), validar a implantação e executar rollback se necessário.

Resumo rápido
- Criar nova versão do segredo no Secret Manager
- Atualizar Cloud Run (Edit & Deploy) para usar a versão `latest` do segredo e garantir `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` está correto
- Validar endpoints (Cloud Run e Firebase Hosting)
- Revogar a chave antiga no provedor e desabilitar versões antigas do Secret Manager

Passo a passo (Console UI — recomendado quando `gcloud` não está disponível)

1) Criar nova versão do segredo
- Console → Security → Secret Manager → selecionar `AI_API_KEY` → `Add new version`
- `Enter secret value` → cole a nova chave (não faça paste em chat ou VCS)
- Salvar. Anote o número da versão criada.

2) Conferir permissões da Service Account
- Console → Cloud Run → selecionar `mjrp-proxy` → anote `Service account` usado pela revisão
- Console → IAM & Admin → localizar essa service account
- Verificar que exista o papel `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` (`roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`). Caso não exista, adicionar.

3) Criar nova revisão do Cloud Run com o segredo
- Console → Cloud Run → `mjrp-proxy` → `Edit & Deploy New Revision`
- Aba `Variables & Secrets` (ou `Environment variables & secrets`):
  - Em `Secrets` → `Add secret` → Source = Secret Manager → Secret = `AI_API_KEY` → Version = `Latest` → Mount as = Environment variable `AI_API_KEY`
  - Em `Environment variables` adicionar/atualizar: `ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app` (ou múltiplos, separados por vírgula)
- Deploy.

4) Verificações pós-deploy (UI + local)
- Console → Cloud Run → confirmar nova revisão `Ready` e com tráfego
- Console → Logging → Logs Explorer: filtrar por `resource.type=cloud_run_revision` e `resource.labels.service_name="mjrp-proxy"` para checar erros

Comandos de verificação local (terminal)
- Health check (Cloud Run):
```bash
curl -i https://<cloud-run-url>/_health
```
- Teste via Firebase Hosting (verifica rewrite + CORS):
```bash
curl -i https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app/api/generate \
  -H "Origin: https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"albumQuery":"Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin I"}'
```
- Verifique:
  - HTTP 200 e corpo JSON esperado
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app`

5) Revogar chave antiga no provedor
- No painel do provedor da chave (Google Cloud API Keys, OpenAI, etc.) localizar e desativar/revogar a chave antiga.
- Só faça a revogação após confirmar que a nova chave está funcionando na runtime.

6) Limpeza no Secret Manager (opcional/por política)
- Console → Secret Manager → `AI_API_KEY` → `Versions` → desabilitar (`Disable`) versões antigas que não serão mais usadas.

Rollback (se necessário)
- Cloud Run mantém revisões. Para reverter para a revisão anterior:
  - Console → Cloud Run → `mjrp-proxy` → `Revisions` → selecionar a revisão anterior → `Split traffic` ou `Migrate traffic` (ou usar `Edit & Deploy` e escolher a imagem/revision desejada).
- Se a nova revisão falhar por problemas de credenciais, reverta tráfego para a revisão anterior e inspecione logs para diagnosticar.

Checklist de verificação rápida (antes de revogar chave antiga)
- [ ] Nova revisão do Cloud Run está `Ready`
- [ ] Logs da nova revisão não mostram erros de autenticação 403/401
- [ ] Endpoint via Hosting retorna 200 e `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` correto
- [ ] Smoke-tests funcionais confirmados manualmente ou via script

Notas operacionais
- Nunca registre ou exponha valores de segredos em logs ou variáveis de ambiente que sejam enviadas a sistemas de terceiros.
- Prefira usar `Latest` nas atualizações de revisão para simplificar rotação; controle e auditoria são mantidos em Secret Manager por versão.
- Para deploys automáticos com GitHub Actions, considere usar OIDC para autenticar no Google Cloud sem chaves de serviço de longa duração.

Se quiser, eu posso: (A) criar uma issue no GitHub com este runbook formatado; (B) commitar este arquivo (já fiz isso); (C) adicionar um pequeno script `scripts/check-secret-rotation.sh` para validar automaticamente (requer `gcloud`). Diga a opção desejada.



# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\devops\SECURITY_ARCHIVED_20251210.md
--------------------------------------------------
````markdown
Security notes

- Do NOT commit your AI API key to the repository. Use environment variables (see `.env.example`).
- This project includes a small server-side proxy (`/server`) to keep secrets off the client.
- Run the proxy locally and set `AI_API_KEY` in your environment before starting it.
- If deploying, set the env var in your hosting platform's secret manager (Vercel/Netlify/AWS/GCP etc.).

Quick start

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill `AI_API_KEY` and optionally `AI_ENDPOINT`.
2. Install server deps:

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

3. Run the proxy:

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

4. In the browser app, ensure the static server is running on port 8000 and the proxy on port 3000.

Client changes

- The frontend `public/js/app.js` now calls `/api/generate` on the proxy rather than the AI provider directly.
- Keep API keys only on the server.

Additional notes:

- The server now optionally validates album objects returned by the AI provider using `ajv` (if `ajv` is installed in `server/`). Validation failures are returned with HTTP `422` and a `validationErrors` array in the response. This helps detect malformed provider responses early.
- If you see repeated `422` responses during testing, check the proxy logs (server console or `/tmp/proxy.log`) for `Album validation failed` messages and inspect the raw provider response.

Additional anti-hallucination note (2025-11-23):

- The proxy includes lightweight URL verification for `referenceUrl` values returned by the AI model. Model-provided URLs that cannot be verified are nulled before being persisted or surfaced to the UI. BestEverAlbums URLs are treated as trusted provenance when they are returned by the server-side scraper.

Operational note: during local development on 2025-11-23 the proxy was restarted and the health endpoint responded `{ "ok": true }` after fixes to the ranking flow.

Running the proxy with AJV enabled:

```bash
cd server
npm install ajv
node index.js
```

Useful endpoints:

- `GET /_health` — quick health check, returns `{ ok: true }` when the proxy is running.
- `GET /api/list-models` — lists models (if using Google Generative Language endpoint and API key configured).
- `POST /api/generate` — submit `{ albumQuery }` and receive normalized `{ data: <album> }` when successful.

# v2.0 Deployment - Mudanças e Impacto

**TL;DR**: ✅ **Backend sem mudanças, Frontend ganha apenas 1 build step**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Status (2025-12-09)**: `firebase.json` atualizado para `"public": "dist"` conforme especificado abaixo.

---

## Comparação: v1.6.1 vs. v2.0

### Backend (Cloud Run)

#### ❌ O que NÃO muda

**Backend continua 100% igual**:
- ✅ Mesmo `server/Dockerfile`
- ✅ Mesmo `scripts/deploy-backend.sh`
- ✅ Mesmas variáveis de ambiente
- ✅ Mesmo processo de deploy

**Por quê?**  
Vite é **só para frontend**. Backend Node.js/Express continua exatamente como está.

```bash
# Deploy backend v2.0 (IDÊNTICO ao v1.6.1)
./scripts/deploy-backend.sh

# Nenhuma mudança necessária! 🎉
```

---

### Frontend (Firebase Hosting)

#### 🔄 O que MUDA

**Setup atual (v1.6.1)**:
```bash
# firebase.json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "public",  # Serve arquivos direto
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"]
  }
}

# Deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Setup novo (v2.0)**:
```bash
# firebase.json (ATUALIZADO)
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",  # ← MUDANÇA: serve build output
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"  # ← SPA routing
      }
    ]
  }
}

# Deploy (COM BUILD)
npm run build           # ← NOVO STEP
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Resumo da mudança**:
1. ➕ Adicionar `npm run build` antes do deploy
2. 🔄 Mudar `"public": "public"` → `"public": "dist"`
3. ➕ Adicionar `rewrites` para SPA routing

**Isso é tudo!** 

---

## Deploy Scripts Atualizados

### v1.6.1 (Atual)
```bash
# scripts/deploy-prod.sh (atual)
#!/bin/bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### v2.0 (Novo)
```bash
# scripts/deploy-prod.sh (atualizado - APENAS 1 LINHA NOVA)
#!/bin/bash

# Build frontend
npm run build  # ← ÚNICA LINHA NOVA

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Diferença**: Literalmente 1 linha (`npm run build`)

---

## Variáveis de Ambiente

### Backend (Cloud Run)

#### ❌ Sem mudanças

```bash
# v1.6.1 (atual)
AI_API_KEY=xxx
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app
NODE_ENV=production
AI_ENDPOINT=...
AI_MODEL=...

# v2.0 (IDÊNTICO)
AI_API_KEY=xxx
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app
NODE_ENV=production
AI_ENDPOINT=...
AI_MODEL=...
```

**Nenhuma variável nova necessária!**

---

### Frontend (Firebase Hosting)

#### ❌ Sem mudanças

```javascript
// public/config.js (v1.6.1 e v2.0 - IDÊNTICO)
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "xxx",
  authDomain: "mjrp-playlist-generator.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "mjrp-playlist-generator",
  storageBucket: "...",
  messagingSenderId: "...",
  appId: "..."
}
```

**Config continua hard-coded no arquivo (como antes)**

**Por quê não usar .env?**
- Frontend é público (build estático)
- Firebase config não é secreto (safe expor)
- Vite suporta `.env`, mas não é necessário aqui

---

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

### Workflow Atual (.github/workflows/ci-firebase.yml)

#### O que precisa mudar:

```diff
# .github/workflows/ci-firebase.yml

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      # Backend (SEM MUDANÇAS)
      - name: Install backend deps
        run: cd server && npm ci
      - name: Test backend
        run: cd server && npm test
      
+     # Frontend (NOVO BUILD STEP)
+     - name: Install frontend deps
+       run: npm ci
+     - name: Build frontend
+       run: npm run build
      
      # Deploy (SEM MUDANÇAS)
      - name: Deploy to Firebase
        run: firebase deploy --only hosting
        env:
          FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}
```

**Mudanças**:
1. ➕ `npm ci` (instalar Vite)
2. ➕ `npm run build` (build frontend)

**Secrets**: ZERO novos secrets necessários

---

## Configurações no Google Cloud Console

### Cloud Run (Backend)

#### ❌ ZERO mudanças

- Service name: `mjrp-proxy` (mesmo)
- Region: `southamerica-east1` (mesmo)
- Container port: `3000` (mesmo)
- Environment variables: (mesmas)
- IAM: (mesmo)
- CPU/Memory: (mesmo)

**Nenhuma configuração nova!**

---

### Firebase Hosting (Frontend)

#### 🔄 Mudanças mínimas

**No console Firebase** (apenas 1 vez):

Nenhuma configuração manual necessária! `firebase.json` define tudo.

**Opcionalmente** (se quiser):
- Performance Monitoring: Continua funcionando
- Analytics: Continua funcionando
- Hosting headers: Pode adicionar cache headers para `/dist/assets/*`

---

## Migração Passo a Passo

### Fase 1: Desenvolvimento (feature branch)

```bash
# Já em feature/v2.0-foundation
npm install  # Instala Vite
npm run dev  # Testa localmente

# Backend continua rodando separado
cd server && npm start
```

**Impacto**: ZERO - Só no seu computador

---

### Fase 2: Staging/Preview

```bash
# Build local
npm run build

# Preview local
npm run preview
# OU
firebase serve --only hosting

# Testa se funciona
```

**Impacto**: ZERO - Só preview local

---

### Fase 3: Deploy Produção

```bash
# 1. Atualizar firebase.json (1x apenas)
# 2. Atualizar scripts/deploy-prod.sh (adicionar npm run build)
# 3. Deploy
./scripts/deploy-prod.sh
```

**Impacto**: 
- ✅ Firebase Hosting continua servindo
- ✅ URL continua a mesma
- ✅ Backend não afetado
- ✅ Rollback fácil (reverter deploy)

---

## Rollback Plan

Se v2.0 quebrar algo:

### Opção 1: Rollback Firebase Hosting (30 segundos)

```bash
# Firebase Hosting guarda histórico de deploys
firebase hosting:channel:deploy previous

# OU no console Firebase:
# Hosting → Release History → "Rollback to this version"
```

**Tempo**: ~30 segundos  
**Impacto**: ZERO downtime

---

### Opção 2: Rollback Git (2 minutos)

```bash
# Volta para tag v1.6working-in-prod
git checkout v1.6working-in-prod

# Rebuild e deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Tempo**: ~2 minutos  
**Impacto**: Mínimo

---

## Comparação: Complexidade de Deploy

### Webpack/CRA (se você escolhesse)

```bash
# Muitas configs:
- webpack.config.js (200+ linhas)
- .babelrc
- webpack-dev-server config
- Proxy config separado
- Env vars complexas
- Build pode quebrar com updates

# Deploy:
npm run build  # 1-5 minutos
```

### Vite (minha recomendação)

```bash
# 1 arquivo config:
- vite.config.js (30 linhas)

# Deploy:
npm run build  # 10-30 segundos
```

**Vite é mais simples!**

---

## Custos

### v1.6.1 (Atual)

- Firebase Hosting: Spark Plan (grátis)
- Cloud Run: Pay-per-use (~$0-5/mês)

### v2.0 (Novo)

- Firebase Hosting: Spark Plan (grátis) ← **SEM MUDANÇA**
- Cloud Run: Pay-per-use (~$0-5/mês) ← **SEM MUDANÇA**

**Build CI** (GitHub Actions):
- Adiciona ~30s por deploy
- Dentro do free tier (2000 min/mês)

**Custo adicional**: $0

---

## Performance em Produção

### Bundle Size

**v1.6.1** (sem bundler):
```
public/js/app.js          ~80 KB
public/js/curation.js     ~40 KB
public/js/api.js          ~10 KB
Sortable.js               ~90 KB
Total:                    ~220 KB
```

**v2.0** (com Vite):
```
dist/assets/index-abc123.js    ~150 KB (minified + gzipped)
dist/assets/vendor-xyz789.js   ~60 KB  (Sortable separado)
Total:                         ~210 KB
```

**Melhoria**: ~10 KB menor + code splitting

---

### Loading Speed

**v1.6.1**:
- 6 requests HTTP separados
- Sem cache hash (pode servir versão velha)
- Sem minificação

**v2.0**:
- 2-3 requests (chunking inteligente)
- Hash no filename (cache perfeito)
- Minificado + tree-shaked

**Resultado**: ~20-30% mais rápido

---

## Production Readiness Checklist

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Última atualização**: 2025-12-10
> Este checklist foi criado baseado nos Issues #33 e #34 do DEBUG_LOG.md para evitar problemas recorrentes.

---

### 🔧 Frontend Deploy Checklist

#### Pre-Build
- [ ] `firebase.json` está com `"public": "dist"` (NÃO `"public"`)
- [ ] Nenhuma dependência está em `external` no `vite.config.js` (axios, etc.)
- [ ] Sem CDN scripts desnecessários no `index.html`

#### Build
- [ ] `npm run build` executa sem erros
- [ ] Build output está em `dist/` (não `public/`)
- [ ] Verificar que `dist/assets/main-*.js` existe e tem tamanho > 100KB

#### Static Files Copy
- [ ] `firebase-config.js` copiado para `dist/js/`
- [ ] `css/modals.css` copiado para `dist/css/`
- [ ] Outros assets (`favicon.ico`, `assets/`) copiados

> **Comando**: `./scripts/deploy-prod.sh` já faz tudo isso automaticamente.

#### Deploy
- [ ] `firebase deploy --only hosting` executa sem erros
- [ ] Console mostra "found X files in dist" (deve ser ~20-30 arquivos)

---

### 🖥️ Backend Deploy Checklist

#### Pre-Deploy
- [ ] `shared/` folder contém todos os módulos necessários:
  - `normalize.js` ✅
  - `curation.js` ✅ (adicionado em 2025-12-10)
- [ ] `server/index.js` importa de `../shared/` (NÃO de `../public/`)
- [ ] Nenhum import de `../public/js/` no código do servidor

#### Deploy
- [ ] `./scripts/deploy-backend.sh` executa sem erros
- [ ] Cloud Run mostra nova revisão deployada

#### Container Structure
O container Docker deve ter:
```
/usr/src/app/      → server code (index.js, lib/, etc.)
/usr/src/shared/   → shared modules (normalize.js, curation.js)
```

**NÃO deve ter**: `/usr/src/public/` (frontend é separado)

---

### ✅ Post-Deploy Validation

#### Frontend (https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app)
- [ ] App carrega sem erros no console
- [ ] Sem erros de "Failed to resolve module specifier"
- [ ] Firebase Auth inicializa corretamente
- [ ] Data Migration banner aparece (se aplicável)

#### Backend (/api endpoints)
- [ ] `/api/generate` (Load Albums) funciona
- [ ] `/api/playlists` (Generate Playlists) funciona - retorna 200
- [ ] Logs do Cloud Run sem erros 500

#### Smoke Tests
- [ ] Criar nova série
- [ ] Carregar álbuns via Load Albums
- [ ] Gerar playlists
- [ ] Navegar entre views (Home, Albums, Playlists, Inventory)

---

### 🔄 Rollback Plan

#### Frontend (Firebase Hosting)
```bash
# Via console ou CLI
firebase hosting:channel:deploy previous

# Ou no console Firebase:
# Hosting → Release History → "Rollback to this version"
```

#### Backend (Cloud Run)
```bash
# Listar revisões
gcloud run revisions list --service=mjrp-proxy --region=southamerica-east1

# Rollback para revisão específica
gcloud run services update-traffic mjrp-proxy \
  --to-revisions=mjrp-proxy-XXXXX=100 \
  --region=southamerica-east1
```

---

### 📋 Known Issues Reference

| Issue | Sintoma | Causa | Solução |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| #33 | `Failed to resolve module specifier "axios"` | `firebase.json` com `"public": "public"` | Mudar para `"public": "dist"` |
| #34 | `/api/playlists` retorna 500 | Import de `../public/js/curation.js` | Usar `../shared/curation.js` |

---

## Resposta Direta às Suas Perguntas

### 1. "O que mudará nos deployments?"

**Backend**: Nada  
**Frontend**: Adicionar 1 step (`npm run build`)

---

### 2. "Conseguirei fazer normalmente via Cloud Run?"

**Sim!** Cloud Run não muda nada. Deploy backend continua:
```bash
./scripts/deploy-backend.sh  # Exatamente como antes
```

---

### 3. "Terei que fazer muitas configurações novas no console?"

**Não!** 
- Cloud Run: ZERO configs novas
- Firebase Hosting: ZERO configs no console (tudo via `firebase.json`)

---

### 4. "E variáveis de ambiente?"

**Backend**: Mesmas variáveis  
**Frontend**: Mesmas configurações (hard-coded, não secret)

**ZERO variáveis novas!**

---

## Recomendação

### Migração Segura

1. **Desenvolver em branch** ✅ (já estamos em `feature/v2.0-foundation`)
2. **Testar localmente** (`npm run build` + `npm run preview`)
3. **Deploy staging** (Firebase Hosting preview channel)
4. **Deploy produção** (quando aprovado)
5. **Rollback pronto** (Firebase guarda histórico)

### Benefícios vs. Complexidade

**Benefícios**:
- ⚡ Dev experience muito melhor (HMR)
- 📦 Bundle otimizado (menor, mais rápido)
- 🎯 Code splitting automático
- 🔍 Source maps para debug

**Complexidade adicionada**:
- ➕ 1 linha no script de deploy
- ➕ 1 arquivo de config (vite.config.js)
- ➕ npm install Vite (1x)

**Trade-off**: Vale muito a pena! 🚀

---

## Conclusão

**Deployment v2.0 é**:
- ✅ **Simples**: Apenas 1 build step novo
- ✅ **Seguro**: Rollback fácil
- ✅ **Sem custos**: $0 adicional
- ✅ **Sem configs**: ZERO variáveis novas
- ✅ **Backend inalterado**: Cloud Run continua igual

**Você pode começar tranquilo!** 

Alguma dúvida específica sobre deploy que ficou? Posso criar um script de deploy de teste para você ver antes de aprovar?

# Implementation Plan - Sprint 6: Authentication & Persistence

## Goal
Implement secure authentication (Google/Apple) and persist user-specific data (Inventory, Custom Series, Playlists) to Firestore, marking the transition from a Local-First to a Cloud-Synced application.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Data Migration Strategy**: On first login, existing LocalStorage data (Guest Mode) will be **copied** to Firestore. LocalStorage will then be cleared or ignored in favor of Cloud Single Source of Truth to prevent sync conflicts.

## Proposed Architecture Changes

### 1. New Core Modules
- **`services/AuthService.js`**: Adapter for Firebase Authentication SDK. Handles popups, redirects, and session monitoring.
- **`stores/UserStore.js`**: Manages current user state (`currentUser`, `isAuthenticated`), controls the Login/Logout flows, and triggers data sync.

### 2. Repository Layer Enhancements
Current Repositories (`AlbumsRepository`, `SeriesRepository`) usually interact with `IndexedDB` or global `Firestore`.
- **Change**: Introduce `RepositoryContext`.
    - **Guest Mode**: Read/Write to `IndexedDB` (BrowserStorage).
    - **Auth Mode**: Read/Write to `Firestore` paths `/users/{uid}/...`.
- **Implementation**: `RepositoryFactory` or dependency injection in Stores to switch drivers based on `UserStore` state.

### 3. UI Components
- **`components/auth/UserMenu.js`**: Avatar, Name, Logout button.
- **`components/auth/LoginModal.js`**: "Sign in with Google", "Sign in with Apple".
- **`features/Header.js`**: Update to conditionally render `UserMenu` or "Sign In" button.

## Proposed Changes (Files)

### Shared / Services
#### [NEW] [AuthService.js](file:///server/services/AuthService.js)
- `signInWithGoogle()`
- `signInWithApple()`
- `signOut()`
- `onAuthStateChanged(callback)`

### Stores
#### [NEW] [UserStore.js](file:///public/js/stores/UserStore.js)
- Observable store.
- Subscribes to `AuthService`.
- On login: Triggers `DataSyncService.migrateGuestToCloud()`.
- On logout: Clears application state.

### Data Layer
#### [MODIFY] [BaseRepository.js](file:///public/js/repositories/BaseRepository.js)
- Add support for user-scoped paths (e.g., set `userId` context).

#### [NEW] [DataSyncService.js](file:///public/js/services/DataSyncService.js)
- `mergeLocalToCloud(uid)`: Reads all LocalStorage/IndexedDB data and batch writes to `/users/{uid}` subcollections.

### UI
#### [NEW] [LoginModal.js](file:///public/js/components/LoginModal.js)
#### [NEW] [UserMenu.js](file:///public/js/components/UserMenu.js)
#### [MODIFY] [Header.js](file:///public/js/components/Header.js)

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests (Vitest)
- **UserStore**: Mock `AuthService` and test state transitions.
- **DataSyncService**: Test migration logic with mock LocalStorage and Mock Firestore.
- **Repository**: Test context switching triggers.

### Manual Verification
1. **Guest Flow**: Use app, create custom series, add inventory.
2. **Login Flow**: Sign in with Google.
3. **Verify Persistence**: Check Firestore Console for `/users/{uid}/inventory`.
4. **Session**: Refresh page -> maintained state.
5. **Logout**: Data clears from UI.
6. **Cross-Device**: Login on Incognito -> see same data.

--------------------------------------------------
# Feature Specification: Authentication (Apple & Google) + Persistence

**Feature Branch**: `06-auth-persistence`  
**Created**: 2025-12-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Sprint 6: Authentication (Apple & Google) and User Data Persistence" (Source: Roadmap.md)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Sign In with Google (Priority: P1)

A user wants to sign in using their Google Account to access personalized features.

**Why this priority**: Core requirement for user identification. Google is a primary identity provider.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking "Sign In" -> "Google" and verifying the user state changes to authenticated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is guest, **When** they click "Sign In" > "Google", **Then** a popup appears for Google Auth.
2. **Given** successful Google Auth, **When** popup closes, **Then** UI updates to show User Avatar/Name in header.
3. **Given** auth error (e.g. closed popup), **When** flow ends, **Then** an error toast is displayed and user remains guest.

---

### User Story 2 - Sign In with Apple (Priority: P1)

A user wants to sign in using their Apple ID for privacy and convenience.

**Why this priority**: Required for iOS ecosystem integration and user choice.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking "Sign In" -> "Apple" and verifying authentication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is guest, **When** they click "Sign In" > "Apple", **Then** they are redirected/popup to Apple Sign In.
2. **Given** successful Apple Auth, **When** returned to app, **Then** UI updates to show User state.
3. **Given** successful auth, **When** inspecting user data, **Then** email is present (if shared by user).

---

### User Story 3 - Persistence: User Profile (Priority: P1)

The system must persist basic user identity to the cloud.

**Why this priority**: Required to identify the owner of the data.

**Independent Test**: Verify Firestore document `/users/{uid}` exists after login.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user, **When** they sign in, **Then** a profile is created at `/users/{uid}` with `displayName` and `email`.
2. **Given** an existing user, **When** they sign in, **Then** `lastLoginAt` is updated.

---

### User Story 6 - Persistence: Business Data (Priority: P1)

Users expect their Albums, Inventory, and Playlists to be saved to their account.

**Why this priority**: **Critical User Value**. Without this, login has no utility.

**Independent Test**: Create inventory as Guest -> Login -> Verify inventory exists in Firestore under `/users/{uid}/inventory` (or linked collection).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Guest user with local Inventory/Playlists, **When** they Sign In (Google/Apple), **Then** their local data is merged/uploaded to their Cloud account.
2. **Given** a Logged In user, **When** they add an album to Inventory, **Then** it is saved to Firestore.
3. **Given** a Logged In user, **When** they log out and log in on another device, **Then** their Inventory matches the cloud state.

---

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to authenticate via Google and Apple.
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist User Profile (`/users/{uid}`) with name and email.
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist User Inventory (`/users/{uid}/inventory` or structured collection).
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist User Playlists (`/users/{uid}/playlists`).

--------------------------------------------------
# Sprint 6 Phase 7: Data Enrichment & Polish Specification

## 1. Overview
This sprint aims to resolve two key user experience limitations identified in the production candidate:
1.  **Missing Album Covers**: The current `albums.csv` dataset lacks image URLs.
2.  **Limited Autocomplete**: The dataset is restricted to the top 3,000 "Acclaimed Music" albums, missing discographies of major artists.

## 2. Architecture: "Static Data Enrichment"
Instead of migrating to a fully dynamic search (which adds latency and complexity), we will generate a robust **static dataset** at build/script time.

### Component Diagram
`scripts/generate-dataset.js` (Node.js) --> **Discogs API** --> `public/assets/data/albums-expanded.json` (Chunked?) --> `AlbumLoader.js` (Frontend)

## 3. Implementation Plan

### 3.1 Data Generation Script (`scripts/generate-dataset.js`)
A Node.js utility that performs the following:
1.  **Input**: Reads `public/assets/data/albums.csv` to get the list of "Acclaimed" albums/artists.
2.  **Enrichment (Covers)**: Search **Discogs API** (Release/Master search) to get the cover image URL.
3.  **Expansion (Discography)**: Search Discogs for the Artist's "Main Releases" (Albums) to populate autocomplete.
4.  **Output**: Saves to `public/assets/data/albums-db.json`.

### 3.2 Chunking Strategy
To prevent a large JSON file blocking load:
- **Core Chunk (`albums-core.json`)**: The original 3,000 albums. Loaded immediately.
- **Expansion Chunks (`albums-search-index.json`)**: Loaded lazily for search.

### 3.3 Frontend Updates
- **`AlbumLoader.js`**: Handle JSON loading.
- **`InventoryRepository.js`**: Persist cover URLs.

## 4. Requirement: API Credentials
- **Apple Music**: Blocked (Requires Active Developer Program).
- **Discogs**: Selected.
    - Requires: `DISCOGS_TOKEN` (Personal Access Token - Free).

## 5. Verification
- Run script with Discogs Token.
- Verify Covers match (Discogs covers can be user-uploaded, may need fallback logic).
- Verify Discography expansion.

  "sub": "MUSIC_APP_ID"
}
```

---

### Phase 2: MusicKit Frontend Service (P1)

**Goal**: Initialize MusicKit and search for albums/artwork.

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 2.1 | Create `MusicKitService.js` singleton |
| 2.2 | Implement `init()` - fetch token, configure MusicKit |
| 2.3 | Implement `searchAlbums(artist, album)` - return Apple Music data |
| 2.4 | Implement `getArtworkUrl(album, size)` - construct template URL |
| 2.5 | Implement `getArtistAlbums(artistId)` - fetch official discography |

**MusicKit Config**:
```javascript
MusicKit.configure({
  developerToken: await fetchToken(),
  app: {
    name: 'Album Playlist Synthesizer',
    build: '2.0.0'
  }
});
```

---

### Phase 3: Album Covers Enrichment (P1)

**Goal**: Update `albums-expanded.json` with Apple Music artwork URLs.

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 3.1 | Create `enrich-album-covers.js` script |
| 3.2 | For each album: search Apple Music → get artwork template |
| 3.3 | Update JSON with `appleMusicId`, `artworkTemplate` |
| 3.4 | Fallback to existing Discogs `coverUrl` if not found |
| 3.5 | Run script on full dataset (~30k albums) |

**Artwork Template Format**:
```json
{
  "artworkTemplate": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/abc123/{w}x{h}bb.jpg",
  "coverUrl": "https://i.discogs.com/..." // fallback
}
```

---

### Phase 4: Autocomplete Integration (P1)

```

---

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests

| Test | Location | Coverage |
|------|----------|----------|
| Token JWT validity | `test/services/MusicKitTokenService.test.js` | Signature, expiry, claims |
| MusicKitService mock | `test/services/MusicKitService.test.js` | Search, artwork construction |

### Manual Verification

| Scenario | Steps | Expected |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Cover quality | 1. Open /albums 2. View cards | 500px+ artwork, sharp |
| Autocomplete HD | 1. Type "Metallica" 2. View dropdown | HD thumbnails visible |
| Playlist export | 1. Generate playlist 2. Export | Playlist appears in Apple Music app |

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Apple rejects token | Validate .p8 key format, test in dev first |
| Rate limiting | Implement exponential backoff, queue exports |
| Track not found | Show warning, allow manual search |
| User denies auth | Clear error message, retry option |

---

## Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Effort | Dependencies |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Phase 1 (Token) | 2h | AuthKey .p8 in secrets |
| Phase 2 (Service) | 3h | Phase 1 |
| Phase 3 (Covers) | 4h | Phase 2 |
| Phase 4 (Autocomplete) | 2h | Phase 3 |
| Phase 5 (Export) | 4h | Phase 2 |
| **Total** | **~15h** | |

---

## Next Steps

1. User approves this plan
2. Create `tasks.md` with granular checklist
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation

--------------------------------------------------
# Feature Specification: Apple Music Integration

**Feature Branch**: `sprint-7-apple-music`  
**Created**: 2025-12-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User requirement for high-quality album covers, official discography data, and playlist export to Apple Music.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - High-Quality Album Covers (Priority: P1)

As a user browsing my album collection, I want to see **high-resolution album artwork** (500px+) on album cards and in the autocomplete dropdown, so the app feels premium and visually polished.

**Why this priority**: Current Discogs covers are low quality (150px thumbnails). Visual quality directly impacts perceived app quality - a P1 user experience issue.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to Albums view, verify all album cards display sharp, high-resolution artwork. No blurry or pixelated images.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an album exists in the system, **When** I view the album card, **Then** the cover art is at least 500x500px and loads quickly.
2. **Given** I search for an album in autocomplete, **When** results appear, **Then** each result shows a thumbnail of the official cover art.
3. **Given** an album has no cover in Apple Music, **When** displayed, **Then** a tasteful placeholder is shown (not broken image).

---

### User Story 2 - Official Discography Data (Priority: P1)

As a user adding albums to my series, I want the autocomplete to show **only official studio and live albums** from an artist's discography (no bootlegs, compilations, or singles), so I can easily find the albums I care about.

**Why this priority**: Current Discogs data includes bootlegs, tour recordings, and compilations that clutter autocomplete. This is a P1 usability issue.

**Independent Test**: Type "Metallica" in autocomplete, verify only official albums appear (Kill 'Em All → 72 Seasons), not M72 tour bootlegs or compilations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I type an artist name, **When** autocomplete shows results, **Then** only studio albums, live albums, and EPs from official discography appear.
2. **Given** an artist has multiple album types, **When** I search, **Then** results are sorted by release year (newest first).
3. **Given** Apple Music has complete discography, **When** I search, **Then** I see ALL official releases (e.g., 72 Seasons for Metallica).

---

### User Story 3 - Playlist Export to Apple Music (Priority: P2)

As a user who has generated balanced playlists, I want to **export my playlists directly to my Apple Music library**, so I can listen to them on any Apple device.

**Why this priority**: This is the "killer feature" for Apple ecosystem users, but requires P1 data quality first.

**Independent Test**: Generate a playlist, click "Export to Apple Music", sign in if needed, verify playlist appears in Apple Music app.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have generated playlists, **When** I click "Export to Apple Music", **Then** I am prompted to authorize if not already signed in.
2. **Given** I am authorized, **When** I export a playlist, **Then** a new playlist is created in my Apple Music library with matching tracks.
3. **Given** a track is not available in Apple Music, **When** exporting, **Then** I see a warning about which tracks couldn't be added.
4. **Given** export succeeds, **When** I open Apple Music, **Then** I see my playlist with correct name and tracks.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Apple Music API is rate-limited? → Show user-friendly error, retry with backoff.
- What happens when user denies Apple Music authorization? → Clear error message, allow retry.
- What happens when album exists in Discogs but not Apple Music? → Show warning, allow manual search.
- What happens when track names differ slightly between sources? → Fuzzy matching with confidence threshold.

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate users via Apple MusicKit JS.
- **FR-002**: System MUST fetch album artwork in at least 500x500px resolution.

- **FR-004**: System MUST filter autocomplete to show only Studio and Live albums by default.
- **FR-005**: System MUST create playlists in user's Apple Music library via MusicKit API.
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle tracks not found in Apple Music gracefully.
- **FR-007**: System MUST store MusicKit authorization token securely (session-based, not persisted).
- **FR-008**: System MUST respect Apple Music API rate limits (configurable backoff).

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Cover art must load within 500ms (lazy loading acceptable).
- **NFR-002**: Autocomplete search must return within 200ms using cached data.
- **NFR-003**: Playlist export must complete within 30 seconds for up to 100 tracks.

### Key Entities

- **AppleMusicAlbum**: Apple Music album ID, artist, title, year, albumType, artworkUrl, tracks[].
- **AppleMusicTrack**: Track ID, title, duration, isrc, playable.
- **MusicKitAuth**: User token, expiry, capabilities (library write).

---

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of albums display cover art at 500px+ resolution (no Discogs fallback).
- **SC-002**: Autocomplete shows only official discography (0 bootlegs or compilations).
- **SC-003**: Users can export playlists to Apple Music in under 30 seconds.
- **SC-004**: 95%+ track match rate when exporting (based on ISRC or title+artist).
- **SC-005**: User satisfaction: "Export to Apple Music" feature used by 50%+ of active users.

---

## Technical Constraints

### Apple Developer Requirements

- Apple Developer Account with MusicKit enabled.
- App registered with `music` and `music-library-write` capabilities.
- MusicKit JS token generated server-side (requires private key).

### API Limitations

- MusicKit search: 25 results/page by default.
- Library write: Rate limited (~100 requests/minute).
- Token expiry: 6 months (developer token), 1 year (user token).

---

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Apple Developer Account | ✅ Available | User has account |
| MusicKit Key | ⚠️ Pending | Need to generate in Apple Developer Portal |
| Firebase Auth | ✅ Ready | Already configured |
| Data Enrichment V1 | ✅ Ready | Temporary regex filtering in place |

---

## Out of Scope (Sprint 7)

- Apple Music playback within the app (requires more complex MusicKit setup).
- Sync existing Apple Music playlists INTO the app.
- Android/Spotify integration (future sprints).

---

## Decisions (Resolved)

| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Token Generation** | Node.js Server + Secret Manager | AuthKey .p8 stored in GCP Secret Manager, JWT generated on demand via `/api/musickit-token` |
| **Cover Caching** | Template URLs (dynamic sizing) | Store base URL template, frontend constructs size dynamically (100px thumbnail → 500px card → 3000px full) |
| **Cover Fallback** | Discogs fallback | If album not in Apple Music, use existing Discogs cover URL |

# Sprint 7 Part C: Holistic View Revamp Specification

## 1. Goal
Standardize the visual presentation of Album and Series entities across the application to ensure:
1.  **Consistent Performance**: Use `OptimizedAlbumLoader` with standardized thumbnail sizes everywhere.
2.  **Data Visibility**: Eliminate text truncation and image-text overlaps.
3.  **Visual Cohesion**: Apply the "Tech/Sci-Fi" aesthetic (Glassmorphism, Neon) consistently.

## 2. Design System: "The Tech Row"
Instead of "Poster" style cards (vertical, image-dominant), we will shift to "Row" style cards (horizontal, data-dominant).

### 2.1. Standard Album Row (AlbumsView / SeriesView)
*   **Dimensions**: Width 100%, Min-Height ~120px.
*   **Layout**: Flexbox Row.
    *   **Left (Thumbnail)**: Fixed 100x100px (or 120x120px) image. Rounded corners (12px).
    *   **Middle (Metadata)**:
        *   **Title**: 1.25rem (text-xl), Bold, White. No truncation (wrap permitted).
        *   **Artist**: 1rem (text-base), Gray-300.
        *   **Meta Badges**: Year, Track Count, Duration (Flex wrap).
    *   **Right (Actions)**:
        *   Vertical stack or Horizontal row of icons (Delete, Rank, Move).
        *   "View Details" button.

### 2.2. Inventory Row (InventoryView)
*   **Base**: Same as Standard Album Row.
*   **Extensions**:
    *   **Format Badge**: Neon Border pill (e.g., "Vinyl", "CD").
    *   **Price**: Large green text input/display (e.g., "$25.00").
    *   **Status**: Toggle (Owned/Wishlist).

### 2.3. Playlist Series Row (PlaylistsView)
*   **Layout**: Series grouping.
*   **Content**: Series Title, Count.
*   **Thumbnails**: A cluster or stack of small thumbnails (e.g., 3 overlapping 60px covers) to represent the collection.

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1. Unified Component: `AlbumRow.js`
A standard function returning HTML string (to keep vanilla JS performance).

```javascript
export function renderAlbumRow(album, options = {}) {
  const { 
    showInventory = false, 
    showRanking = false, 
    actions = [] 
  } = options;
  
  const coverUrl = albumLoader.getArtworkUrl(album, 150); // Standardized Small/Medium
  
  return `
    <div class="tech-row group ...">
      <!-- Thumbnail -->
      <div class="row-thumb ...">
        <img src="${coverUrl}" loading="lazy" ... />
      </div>
      
      <!-- Metadata -->
      <div class="row-content ...">
        <h3>${album.title}</h3>
        <p>${album.artist}</p>
        <!-- Badges -->
      </div>
      
      <!-- Inventory Slots (if enabled) -->
      ${showInventory ? renderInventoryControls(album) : ''}
      
      <!-- Actions -->
      <div class="row-actions ...">
        ${renderActions(actions)}
      </div>
    </div>
  `
}
```

### 3.2. Optimized Loader Usage
*   All views MUST import `OptimizedAlbumLoader`.
*   All `getArtworkUrl` calls MUST use standardized sizes (100, 150, or 300 max).
*   No more Raw URLs unless optimization fails.

## 4. Migration Plan
1.  **Phase 1**: Create `components/AlbumRow.js` and CSS styles.
2.  **Phase 2**: Refactor `AlbumsView.js` to render rows instead of grid cards.
3.  **Phase 3**: Refactor `InventoryView.js` to use `AlbumRow` with inventory slots.
4.  **Phase 4**: Refactor `PlaylistsView.js` / `SeriesListView.js`.

## 5. Verification
*   **Visual**: All text visible? No overlap?
*   **Performance**: Network tab checks for image sizes (should be <50KB).
*   **Functionality**: Actions (Delete, Edit) still work?

--------------------------------------------------
# UX Proposal: "Load Albums" Experience Redesign
**Sprint 7 - Part A (UI/UX Refinement)**

## 1. Problem Statement
The current "Load Albums" flow in `HomeView` is functional but constrained:
- **Cognitive Load**: Users see a text area and a search bar simultaneously, creating confusion ("Where do I type?").
- **No Immediate Gratification**: Selecting an album from autocomplete just appends text (`Artist - Album`) to a box. The user doesn't see the cover art they just selected until *after* they click "Load Albums" and go to the next screen.
- **Edit Friction**: Removing an album requires precise text selection/backspacing in the textarea.

## 2. Proposed Solution: "Visual Staging Area"
We will transform the experience from a "Text Editor" to a "Playlist Builder".

### Key Concepts
1.  **Visual First**: When a user selects an album, it appears instantly as a **Card** with its cover art, not just text.
2.  **Mode Switching**: Clear separation between **"Interactive Search"** (Default) and **"Bulk/Text Import"** (Power User).
3.  **Unified State**: Both modes feed into the same final list.

## 3. User Journey (New Flow)

### Step 1: Artist Drill-Down (The "Select" Flow)
- **Action**: User types in "Filter by Artist" (e.g., "Metallica").
- **Interaction**: Selecting an artist automatically **REPLACES** the "Search for Album" input with a **Results Grid/Carousel**.
- **Results View**: Shows all albums by that artist (e.g. 5-10 covers).
- **Selection**: User clicks albums in this grid to toggle them into the **Staging Area** below.
- **Persistence**: The Artist Results stay open until the user clears the filter or selects a new artist.

### Step 2: Global Search (Fallback)
- If no artist is filtered, the right side remains a standard "Search for Album" autocomplete.

**Option B: Artist Drill-Down (Structured)**
- User focuses on an **"Artist Filter"** field (or types `@Metallica`).
- Selects "Metallica".
- The Main Search bar now says **"Search albums by Metallica..."**.
- Clicking it shows *only* Metallica albums in a grid/list.
- **Benefit**: Helps when you want to add multiple albums from the same artist without re-typing the name.

### Step 2: Visual Confirmation
- Regardless of method, selecting an album adds the **Card** to the Visual Staging Area.

### Step 2: The "Review" (Staging)
- As users add more albums, they build a **Grid of Covers**.
- This builds excitement ("My series is looking good!").
- They can reorder (optional/future) or remove items easily.

### Step 3: The "Bulk" Option (Text Mode)
- A small text/link says: *"Have a list? Switch to Bulk Paste"*.
- Clicking toggles the view to the classic **Textarea**.
- **Bonus**: If possible, pasting text and switching back to "Visual" could try to parse and hydrate covers (Future scope, maybe just keeping modes separate for now is safer).

## 4. UI Layout Mockup

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## 5. Implementation Strategy
- **State Management**: Introduce a local state `selectedAlbums: []` in `HomeView`.
- **Sync Logic**:
  - **Visual Mode**: Adds to `selectedAlbums`.
  - **Text Mode**: Parses text to `selectedAlbums` (or vice versa).
- **Submit**: Sends the final array to `albumSeriesStore`.

## 6. Visual Style
- **Glassmorphism**: The album cards will use the existing `glass-panel` style but "miniaturized".
- **Animations**: Cards pop in (`animate-in zoom-in`).
- **Feedback**: Success toast or flash when adding.

## 7. Visual Mockup

**Status**: Proposal Ready for Review



# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\sprint-7-apple-music\SPRINT_7_5_LOAD_ALBUM_REFACTOR.md
--------------------------------------------------
# Feature Specification: Load Album Refactor & Visual Polish

**Feature Branch**: `feature/v2.5-load-album-refactor`
**Created**: 2025-12-15
**Status**: APPROVED
**Input**: User request to refactor `loadAlbum` for performance/accuracy (Apple Music) and fix visual regressions (Grid/Grouping).

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Reliable & Fast Album Loading (Priority: P1)

As a user loading an album, I want the system to fetch reliable metadata (Tracks, Cover, Year) directly from a trusted source (Apple Music) without "hallucinations" or slow AI generation, so that I can trust the data and validate it quickly.

**Why this priority**: Correct data is the foundation of the app. The current LLM generation is slow and prone to errors ("Ghost tracks", fake tracklists). Reliability > Visuals.

**Independent Test**: Load "Metallica - 72 Seasons". Verify tracklist matches official Apple Music data exactly (no hallucinations, correct durations) and loads under 2 seconds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I search for an official album (e.g., "Thriller"), **When** I click "Load Album", **Then** the system fetches track metadata directly from Apple Music (Official Discography).
2. **Given** the album is found in Apple Music, **When** it loads, **Then** the cover art is High-Resolution (>500px).
3. **Given** an official album, **When** loading completes, **Then** the tracklist is 100% accurate (no missing or fake tracks).

---

### User Story 2 - Correct Album Validations (Compact View) (Priority: P2)

As a user browsing my collection in Compact Mode, I want albums to appear in a responsive grid (not a single column) and clicking the cover should open the details modal, so I can manage my collection efficiently.

**Why this priority**: Visual regressions make the app feel broken, though data integrity (P1) is more critical for the core value prop.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to `/albums` in Compact View. Resize window. Verify items flow into columns (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am in Compact View, **When** I view the list, **Then** albums are displayed in a responsive grid (multi-column) layout.
2. **Given** I am in Compact View, **When** I click an album cover, **Then** the "View Album" modal opens with correct details.

---

### User Story 3 - Visual Grouping by Series (Expanded View) (Priority: P2)

As a user viewing "All Series" in Expanded Mode, I want to clearly see which series each album belongs to via visual headers and usage of borders, so I can understand the context of my collection.

**Why this priority**: Consistency with Compact View (which already has grouping).

**Independent Test**: Select "All Series" filter. Switch to Expanded View. Verify headers "Series Name" appear above groups of albums.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** "All Series" is selected, **When** in Expanded View, **Then** albums are visually grouped by Series with clear headers/borders.
2. **Given** "Single Series" is selected, **When** in Expanded View, **Then** no Series headers are shown (flat list).

---

## Edge Cases

- What happens when Apple Music is down or album not found?
    - System falls back to legacy LLM generation (`/api/generate`) to ensure continuity.
- What happens if an album is in Apple Music but has no rankings?
    - System uses the `enrich-album` endpoint to generate rankings via LLM/Scraping, applying them to the *official* tracklist.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST query Apple Music API first for album metadata (Tracks, Cover, Year, ISRC).
- **FR-002**: System MUST use a new backend endpoint `/api/enrich-album` to fetch Rankings **only via BestEverAlbums scraping**.
    - If BestEverAlbums data is found: Use it for ranking.
    - If NOT found: Fallback to **Original Album Order** and log a warning to the console: `"[Enrichment] No ratings found for [Album Name]. Using original order."`
- **FR-003**: System MUST NOT use LLM to generating track names if Apple Music data is available.
- **FR-004**: Compact View MUST use CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints (`grid-cols-1`, `md:grid-cols-3`, etc.).
- **FR-005**: Expanded View MUST implement `renderScopedList` (or equivalent) to support Series Grouping logic.

### Key Entities

- **EnrichedAlbum**: `Album` model + `AppleMusicMetadata` + `Rankings` + `BestEverEvidence`.
- **EnrichRequest**: `{ artist, title, tracks: [{ title, duration }] }` payload sent to backend.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: **Accuracy**: 100% match with Apple Music tracklists for top 100 tested albums.
- **SC-002**: **Performance**: "Load Album" time reduced from ~8s (LLM) to ~2s (Apple Search + Enrichment).
- **SC-003**: **Visual Integrity**: Zero layout regressions in Compact/Expanded views (Grid verified, Grouping verified).

--------------------------------------------------
# Documentation Reorganization Plan

**Data**: 2025-12-19 18:40
**Objetivo**: Reorganizar, completar e manter documentação técnica atualizada

---

## Análise do Estado Atual

### Problemas Identificados

1. **Ordenação Confusa** no `data_flow_architecture.md`:
   - Inventory de componentes misturado com flows
   - Seções Sprint 11 no meio/fim do documento
   - Falta hierarquia clara

2. **Duplicação de Conteúdo**:
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` (1251 lines) e `data_flow_architecture.md` cobrem tópicos similares
   - High-level architecture em ambos
   - Stores/Views descritos em ambos

3. **Itens Incompletos** no Inventory:
   - 4 Views sem documentação (❌)
   - 2 Stores sem documentação (❌)
   - 3 Services sem documentação (❌)
   - 4 Models sem documentação (❌)
   - 5 Repositories sem documentação (❌)
   - Vários itens ⚠️ Partial

4. **Docs Potencialmente Obsoletos**:
   - `ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md` - precisa verificar
   - `album_data_schema.md` - pode estar desatualizado
   - Specs antigos em `sprint-7-*`, etc.

---

## Estratégia de Reorganização

### Fase 1: Consolidar Documentação Principal

**Objetivo**: Um único ponto de entrada que referencia docs especializados

```
docs/
├── ARCHITECTURE.md          # MAIN: High-level + Links
├── technical/
│   ├── data_flow_architecture.md  # FLOWS: All sequence diagrams
│   ├── component_reference.md     # NEW: Inventory + API
│   ├── crud_operations.md         # EXTRACT: CRUD flows
│   └── album_data_schema.md       # KEEP: Model schemas
└── specs/
    └── [sprint-specific docs]     # ARCHIVE old, keep recent
```

### Fase 2: Estrutura Recomendada para `data_flow_architecture.md`

```markdown
1. Overview (brief)
2. System High-Level Architecture (mermaid)
3. App Initialization Flow
4. Navigation Map
5. Data Flows by Feature
   5.1 Album Series Flows
   5.2 Playlist Flows
   5.3 Inventory Flows
   5.4 Ranking & Spotify Flows

> Note: For issues, see DEBUG_LOG.md (no issues in this doc)
```

### Fase 3: Criar `component_reference.md`

Mover inventory de `data_flow_architecture.md` para novo arquivo com:
- Para cada componente: Purpose, API, Dependencies, Examples
- Status de documentação
- Links para código fonte

---

## Plano de Execução

### Sprint Doc-1: Reordenar (1-2h)
- [ ] Reorganizar seções do `data_flow_architecture.md`
- [ ] Mover inventory para `component_reference.md`
- [ ] Atualizar TOC

### Sprint Doc-2: Completar Views (2-3h)
- [ ] EditPlaylistView.js - documentar fluxos
- [ ] InventoryView.js - documentar CRUD
- [ ] SavedPlaylistsView.js - documentar fluxos
- [ ] ConsolidatedRankingView.js - documentar

### Sprint Doc-3: Completar Stores/Services (2h)
- [ ] inventory.js store - documentar API
- [ ] UserStore.js - documentar
- [ ] AlbumLoader.js - documentar
- [ ] OptimizedAlbumLoader.js - documentar
- [ ] DataSyncService.js - documentar

### Sprint Doc-4: Completar Models/Repos (1-2h)
- [ ] Album.js, Track.js, Playlist.js, Series.js
- [ ] Repositories - BaseRepository pattern

### Sprint Doc-5: Audit & Archive (1h)
- [ ] Verificar docs obsoletos em archive/
- [ ] Marcar deprecated ou remover
- [ ] Atualizar cross-references

---

## Estratégia de Manutenção

### ✅ Codificada em Workflow

A estratégia foi codificada como workflow invocável:

**Workflow**: `/post-implementation-docs`  
**Arquivo**: `.agent/workflows/post-implementation-docs.md`

### Regra: Update-on-Change (via workflow)

Quando implementar feature, invocar workflow que verifica:
1. Atualizar componente reference se novo/modificado
2. Atualizar flow diagram se fluxo mudou
3. Adicionar entry em DEBUG_LOG se foi bug fix

### Invocação

O usuário pode invocar após implementação:
```
/post-implementation-docs
```

Ou o agente sugere ao final de uma tarefa:
> "Tarefa concluída. Quer que eu rode `/post-implementation-docs`?"

### Review Trimestral
- Audit de docs obsoletos
- Remover/arquivar conteúdo deprecated
- Verificar accuracy dos diagrams

---

## Próximo Passo

# Sprint 11: Implementation Plan

## Spotify Integration & Multi-Source Ranking

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-12-18  
**Branch**: `feature/sprint11-spotify-integration`  
**Estimated Duration**: 2 weeks

---

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Description | Duration | Priority |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | Spotify OAuth Setup | 2 days | HIGH |
| **Phase 2** | Spotify Popularity Ranking | 2 days | HIGH |
| **Phase 3** | Multi-Source Ranking UX | 2 days | HIGH |
| **Phase 4** | Album Cards UI Update | 1 day | MEDIUM |
| **Phase 5** | Export to Spotify | 3 days | MEDIUM |
| **Phase 6** | Testing & Polish | 2 days | HIGH |

---

## Phase 1: Spotify OAuth Setup

### Files to Create/Modify

#### [NEW] `public/js/services/SpotifyAuthService.js`
```javascript
// Spotify OAuth with PKCE flow
// - generateCodeVerifier()
// - generateCodeChallenge()
// - initiateAuth()
// - handleCallback()
// - refreshToken()
// - isAuthenticated()
```

#### [MODIFY] `public/js/app.js`
- Add Spotify callback route handler
- Initialize SpotifyAuthService

#### [NEW] `public/js/components/SpotifyConnectButton.js`
- "Connect to Spotify" button component
- Shows connection status

### Environment Variables

```env
# .env (client-side via Vite)
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app/callback
```

---

## Phase 2: Spotify Popularity Ranking

### Files to Modify

#### [MODIFY] `server/lib/services/spotifyPopularity.js`
- Already exists (136 lines)
- Ensure it returns normalized ranking data

#### [MODIFY] `server/lib/fetchRanking.js`
- Add Spotify as fallback source
- Current: BestEver → AI
- New: BestEver → Spotify → Original

#### [NEW] `server/routes/spotify.js`
```javascript
// POST /api/spotify/album-ranking
// - Fetch album from Spotify
// - Get track popularity
// - Return ranked tracks
```

---

## Phase 3: Multi-Source Ranking UX

### Architecture: Container / Presenter Pattern

To solve the "Table on Desktop vs Tabs on Mobile" challenge, we will use a **Smart Container** that orchestrates two **Dumb Presenters**.

#### 1. Smart Container: `TracksRankingComparison.js`
- **State**:
  - `activeTab` (for mobile)
  - `sortField` (for desktop: 'original', 'acclaim', 'popularity')
  - `sortDirection` ('asc', 'desc')
- **Logic**:
  - **Averages Calculation**: Computes avg(Acclaim) and avg(Popularity) on mounting.
  - **Total Score**: Computes (avgAcclaim + avgPop) / 2.
  - **Normalization**: Ensures every track has a rank.
  - **Responsiveness**: Toggles between Table/Tabs presenters.

#### 2. Desktop Presenter: `TracksTable.js`
- **Props**: `sortedTracks`, `averages`, `albumLinks` (Spotify/BEA)
- **Render**:
  - Full width table
  - **Headers**:
    - "Track Name (Original Album Order)"
    - "Acclaim BEA Rank" (with Orange Badge)
    - "Spotify Popularity Rank" (with Green Badge)
  - **Footer**: Sticky footer showing consolidated averages.

#### 3. Mobile Presenter: `TracksTabs.js`
- **Props**: `tracks`, `activeTab`, `averages`
- **Render**:
  - Tab switcher.
  - Simplified list.
  - Mini-footer with scores.

---

### UI Mockups (Final Decision: Option 5 - Refined Table)

**Desktop (Table)**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Track Name (Original Album Order) | Acclaim BEA Rank | Pop |
├───────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────┤
│ 1. Stairway to Heaven             | #1 ⭐98          │ ... |
│ ...                               | ...              │ ... |
├───────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────┤
│ AVERAGES                          | ⭐ 92.0          │ ... |
└───────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────┘
```


**Mobile (Tabs)**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [ ORIGINAL ]   [ 🏆 ACCLAIM ]   [ 🟢 POPUL. ]    │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. Stairway to Heaven           #4 Org   ⭐ 98   │
│ 2. Black Dog                    #1 Org   ⭐ 92   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### Integration Points

1. **AlbumsView (Expanded Card)**
   - Import `TracksRankingComparison`
   - Pass `album` object
   - Component handles its own layout

2. **ViewAlbumModal (Inventory)**
   - Same integration
   - Ensures consistent sorting/viewing experience across app

---

### Badge Variants (for headers)

| Source | Badge | Color |
|--------|-------|-------|
| BestEver | 🏆 ACCLAIM | `#f97316` (orange-500) |
| Spotify | 🟢 POPULARITY | `#1DB954` (Spotify green) |
| None | ⚪ ORIGINAL | `#6b7280` (gray-500) |

---

### Environment Variables
- `VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` (exposed to client - Auth Code with PKCE)
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` (NOT used on client - PKCE flow)

---

## Phase 5: Export to Spotify (Generated Playlists Only)

### Export Progress Modal (Standardized)
This new component `ExportProgressModal.js` will eventually replace the Apple Music export UI to strictly maintain the same "Standard Pattern" across providers.

**UI State Machine:**
1. `IDLE`: [Export Button] active
2. `MATCHING`: "Searching Spotify for track 1/12..."
3. `CREATING`: "Creating playlist 'My Album'..."
4. `ADDING`: "Adding tracks..."
5. `SUCCESS`: "Done! [Open in Spotify]"
6. `ERROR`: Warning list of unmatched tracks.

---

## 🏗️ Holistic Architectural Analysis (AlbumsView & PlaylistsView)

### 1. The "God Object" Problem (AlbumsView.js)
Current State: `AlbumsView.js` is ~1300 lines, handling too many responsibilities (Filtering, Search, Grid Rendering, Modal Logic, etc.).
**Refactoring Strategy (Sprint 11)**:
- By creating `TracksRankingComparison.js` (Container), we are **extracting** the complex ranking logic OUT of `VIEW` scope.
- `AlbumsView.js` will no longer manually render track lists; it will simply mount the new Container.
- **Impact**: Reduces `AlbumsView.js` complexity and prevents "spaghetti code" when adding a 3rd data source.

### 2. Service Layer Pattern (PlaylistsView.js)
Current State: `PlaylistsView.js` directly calls `albumsStore`, `playlistsStore`, and contains significant business logic in `handleGenerate`.
**Refactoring Strategy (Sprint 11)**:
- We introducing `SpotifyService.js` and `MusicKitService.js` to handle all external IO.
- The View becomes a "dumb" consumer of services, moving towards a proper MVC/MVVM separation.
- **Benefit**: Debugging "Export" issues will be isolated to the Service files, not the UI view file.

### 3. Modularity & Reusability
- **Container/Presenter**: The new `TracksRankingComparison` is context-agnostic. It works in the expanded Album Card, Inventory Modal, and future views without code availability duplication.
- **Standardized Modals**: The `ExportProgressModal` standardizes the "Async Task UI" pattern, replacing ad-hoc loading states in `PlaylistsView`.

**Clean Code Verdict**: This sprint is not just adding features; it is actively **reducing technical debt** by enforcing a strict separation between Data (Service), Logic (Container), and UI (Presenter) across the two main Views.

# Sprint 11: Spotify Integration & Multi-Source Ranking

## Specification Document

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-12-18  
**Branch**: `feature/sprint11-spotify-integration`  
**Status**: 📋 PLANNING

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Sprint 11 introduces Spotify integration as both a **ranking fallback** and **export destination**, creating a more robust and complete playlist generation experience.

### Goals
1. **Multi-Source Ranking**: Spotify popularity as fallback when BestEver fails
2. **Spotify Album Links**: Direct links to Spotify albums in UI
3. **Export to Spotify**: Create playlists directly in user's Spotify account

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| BestEver scraping unreliable | 30%+ albums show "PENDING" badge |
| No ranking fallback | Users see unranked tracks |
| Only Apple Music export | Spotify users excluded |
| No external album links | Users can't quickly open albums in streaming apps |

### User Request
> "Estou pensando em parar de insistir por enquanto no fix do BestEver e utilizar o ranking de popularidade de faixas por album do Spotify... precisamos ter um indicativo visual na UI pra saber de onde veio o ranking."

> **Note**: These changes will be reflected in `docs/technical/album_data_schema.md`

### Album Object (Extended)

```javascript
{
  // Existing fields...
  
  // NEW: Spotify Integration
  spotifyId: "123abc",           // Spotify album ID
  spotifyUrl: "https://open.spotify.com/album/...",
  rankingSource: "acclaim" | "popularity" | "original",
  
  tracks: [
    {
      // Existing fields...
      
      // NEW: Multi-source ranking
      bestEverRank: 3,           // From BestEver (null if unavailable)
      spotifyPopularityRank: 5,  // From Spotify (null if unavailable)
      rank: 3,                   // Final rank used by algorithms
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5.1 Data Flow Architecture

> **Note**: This documents how Spotify data flows into the playlist generation algorithms.

#### Current Flow (BestEver Only)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Data Sources"
        BEA[BestEverAlbums Scraper]
    end
    
    subgraph "Album Model"
        AM[Album.js]
        RC[rankingConsolidated]
        BR[beaRatings]
    end
    
    subgraph "Algorithm Layer"
        LR[LegacyRoundRobinAlgorithm.enrichTracks]
        ALG[SDraft / MJRPCascade.generate]
    end
    
    BEA --> RC & BR
    RC & BR --> AM
    AM --> LR
    LR -->|"track.rank, track.rating"| ALG
```

**Key Files**:
| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `Album.js` | Stores `rankingConsolidated`, `beaRatings` |
| `LegacyRoundRobinAlgorithm.enrichTracks()` | Reads BEA data → sets `.rank` |
| `SDraftOriginalAlgorithm.generate()` | Uses `.rank` for playlist distribution |

#### Proposed Flow (With Spotify Integration)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Data Sources"
        BEA[BestEverAlbums]
        SPF[Spotify API]
    end
    
    subgraph "Services"
        SS[SpotifyService.js]
        TRC[TracksRankingComparison.js]
    end
    
    subgraph "Album Model"
        AM[Album.js]
        SID[spotifyId]
        SPOP[spotifyPopularity]
        TPOP[tracks[].spotifyPopularity]
    end
    
    subgraph "Algorithm Layer"
        LR[enrichTracks - MODIFIED]
        ALG[Algorithms]
    end
    
    SPF --> SS
    SS -->|"On 'Enrich Data' click"| TRC
    TRC -->|"Updates album"| AM
    SID & SPOP & TPOP --> AM
    AM --> LR
    LR -->|"IF rankingSource=='popularity': use spotifyPopularity as rank"| ALG
```

**Integration Points**:
| File | Line | Change Required |
|------|------|-----------------|
| `TracksRankingComparison.js` | 205 | Connect "Enrich" button to `SpotifyService` |
| `LegacyRoundRobinAlgorithm.js` | `enrichTracks()` | Add conditional: if `rankingSource === 'popularity'`, use `spotifyPopularity` as `rank` |
| `AlbumsStore.js` | - | Add method to update album with Spotify data |

---

## 6. API Endpoints

### Spotify Web API (External)

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /v1/search` | Search for albums/tracks |
| `GET /v1/albums/{id}/tracks` | Get album tracks with popularity |
| `POST /v1/users/{id}/playlists` | Create new playlist |
| `POST /v1/playlists/{id}/tracks` | Add tracks to playlist |
| `GET /v1/me` | Get current user profile |

### Internal (Optional)

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /api/spotify/popularity` | Fetch and cache Spotify ranking (server-side) |

---

## 7. UI/UX Mockups

### Album Card with Spotify Badge

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Album Cover Image]             │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Album Title                     │
│ Artist Name                     │
│ ──────────────────────────────  │
│ 🟢 POPULARITY    🔗 Spotify     │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Spotify Export Flow

```
1. [Connect to Spotify] button
      ↓
2. OAuth popup (Spotify login)
      ↓
3. [Export to Spotify] button enabled
      ↓
4. Progress modal: "Matching tracks... 15/45"
      ↓
5. Success: "Playlist created! [Open in Spotify]"
   Warning: "3 tracks not found"
```

---

## 8. Success Criteria

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| PENDING badges reduced | 0% (Eliminate Pending state) |
| Spotify export success rate | >90% tracks matched |
| OAuth flow completion | <30 seconds |
| User satisfaction | Qualitative feedback positive |

---

## 9. Out of Scope

- Spotify playback within app
- Spotify search for albums (use existing Apple Music search)
- Syncing existing Spotify playlists back to app
- Real-time popularity updates

---

## 10. Dependencies

| Dependency | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Spotify Developer Account | ✅ Already exists (see SPOTIFY_SETUP.md) |
| `spotifyPopularity.js` service | ✅ Already exists (136 lines) |
| Spotify Web API credentials | ✅ In `.env` / Cloud Secret Manager |

---

## 11. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Spotify API changes | Use stable endpoints, version lock |
| Rate limiting | Batch requests, add delays |
| Token expiration mid-export | Auto-refresh before operations |
| User denies OAuth scopes | Clear error message, retry option |

# Sprint 11: Tasks Checklist

## Spotify Integration & Multi-Source Ranking

**Branch**: `feature/sprint11-spotify-integration`  
**Created**: 2025-12-18  
**Status**: 📋 PLANNING

---

## Phase 1: Spotify OAuth Setup (2 days)

### Setup
- [x] Register app in Spotify Developer Dashboard
- [x] Get Client ID (don't need Client Secret for PKCE)
- [x] Configure redirect URIs (localhost + production)
- [x] Set required scopes: `playlist-modify-public`, `playlist-modify-private`, `user-read-private`

### Implementation
- [x] Create `SpotifyAuthService.js`
  - [x] `generateCodeVerifier()` - Random 128 chars
  - [x] `generateCodeChallenge()` - SHA256 + Base64URL
  - [x] `initiateAuth()` - Opens Spotify login popup
  - [x] `handleCallback()` - Exchange code for tokens
  - [x] `refreshToken()` - Auto-refresh expired tokens
  - [x] `isAuthenticated()` - Check token validity
  - [x] `logout()` - Clear tokens
- [x] Create `SpotifyConnectButton.js` component
- [x] Add callback route handler in `app.js`
- [x] Store tokens in localStorage

### Verification
- [x] Test OAuth flow in localhost
- [x] Test OAuth flow in production
- [x] Verify token refresh works

---

## Phase 2: Spotify Popularity Ranking (2 days)

### Core Service Logic
- [x] Create `public/js/services/SpotifyService.js`
  - [x] `searchAlbum(artist, albumName)` -> returns Spotify ID
  - [x] `getAlbumDetails(spotifyId)` -> returns tracks with popularity
  - [x] `getAlbumTracksWithPopularity(spotifyId)` -> returns tracks with popularity
  - [x] `calculateAveragePopularity(tracks)` -> returns 0-100 avg
  - [x] Error handling (401 -> refresh token -> retry)
  - [x] **Verification**: Tested via Console.

### Integration
- [x] Update `Album` model (in memory/store) to hold:
  - `spotifyId`
  - `spotifyPopularity` (0-100)
  - `spotifyUrl`
  - `spotifyImages`
- [ ] Update `AlbumsScopedRenderer` (or new logic) to fetch this data on demand (Lazy Loading) to avoid rate limits?
  *Decision*: Fetch only when "Expanded View" is opened OR when "Enrich" is clicked?
  *Refinement*: Plan says "Lazy load when user expands album".

---

### Data Model
- [ ] Add fields to Album object:
  - [ ] `spotifyId`
  - [ ] `spotifyUrl`
  - [ ] `rankingSource` ("acclaim" | "popularity" | "original")
- [ ] Add fields to Track object:
  - [ ] `spotifyPopularityRank`

---

  - [ ] Verify styling consistency within modal
  - [ ] **CRITICAL FIX**: Debug and fix "Add/Remove from Inventory" buttons logic (reported buggy)

### Stylization
- [ ] Implement sorting animations (optional nice-to-have)
- [ ] Ensure "Sticky Headers" for long track lists
- [ ] Tooltip implementation for "Pending" or "Low Data" states

---

## Phase 4: Album Cards UI Update (1 day)

### Compact View
- [ ] Add Spotify icon/link to album cards
- [ ] Show correct badge based on `rankingSource`:
  - [ ] 🏆 ACCLAIM (green) - BestEver
  - [ ] 🟢 POPULARITY (Spotify green) - Spotify

# Implementation Plan: Sprint 11.5 - Stabilization & Refactor

**Branch**: `feature/sprint11.5-stabilization` | **Date**: 2025-12-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Summary

This sprint serves as the foundation for reliable playlist generation. The primary goal is to achieve **Total Ranking Integrity**: solving the critical "Wrong Tracks" bug (#71) and ensuring every album in a series has validated ranking data before the orchestration algorithms (Sprint 12) run.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Javascript (ES6)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Firestore, SortableJS, MusicKit/Spotify SDKs  
**Storage**: Firestore (Primary), localStorage (Cache)  
**Testing**: Manual E2E (Multi-browser), Console Debugging  
**Project Type**: Web Application

## Constitution Check

- **Constraint**: Must keep `AlbumsView.js` functional during refactor.
- **Strategy**: Incremental extraction. We will first extract the **State Logic** before touching the **Render Logic**.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

├── plan.md              # This file
└── tasks.md             # Detailed checklist
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Investigation & Patch (Bug #71)
- Add deterministic logging to `AlbumsView.updateAlbumsGrid`.
- Trace the value of `album.id` passed to `TracksRankingComparison`.
- Check for shared track reference mutation in `Album.js`.
- **Deliverable**: Identification and temporary patch for Bug #71.

### Phase 2: State Extraction (Refactor Start)
- Create `public/js/views/controllers/AlbumsStateController.js`.
- Move `this.filters` and `this.albums` into the controller.
- Implement an Observer pattern inside the controller to notify the View of state changes.
- **Goal**: Resolve Bug #74 (View Toggle) by making the state independent of re-renders.

### Phase 3: Metadata Fixes & Documentation
- Solve Bug #58 (PENDING Badge) by auditing the repository layer.
- Complete documentation for Issue #75 in `data_flow_architecture.md`.
- Final verification of Spotify Export Flow.

# Sprint 11.5 Continuity Plan (Stabilization & Modernization)

**Date**: 2025-12-19
**Context**: Continuation of Sprint 11.5 to address critical regressions, data quality, and UX modernization before Sprint 12 Refactoring.

---

## 1. Architectural Integrity Audit

### ✅ Wins
- **Container/Presenter Pattern**: Isolated `TracksRankingComparison`.
- **Event-Driven Persistence**: Fixed Bug #58 (Pending Badge).
- **Ranking Correctness**: Fixed Bug #71 (Cross-contamination).

### ⚠️ Critical Regressions & Issues
- **Album Deletion**: Component unable to access `activeSeries` context.
- **Data Quality**: Fuzzy matching too strict for "Remastered" albums.
- **UX Consistency**: Modal missing data (ratings/time) available in Expanded View.
- **Outdated UI**: Album Modal does not match Premium aesthetic.

---

## 2. Immediate Action Plan (Phase 4)

### A. Critical Regressions (Priority 1)
- [x] **Fix Album Deletion Bug**: `AlbumSeriesStore.removeAlbumFromSeries` throws "No active series".
    - *Action*: Update `AlbumSeriesStore` to accept `seriesId` fallback and `AlbumsView` to pass it from URL.

### B. Data Quality & UX (Priority 2)
- [ ] **Fix Missing Ratings**: Ensure `TracksTable` displays rating column for Acclaim source.
- [ ] **Fuzzy Logic Expansion**: Apply the working "Remastered-aware" fuzzy logic to `BestEverService`.
- [ ] **Modal Data Fix**: Replicate the "Merge Logic" from Ranking View to `ViewAlbumModal` to show correct durations and ratings.

### C. UX Modernization (Priority 3)
- [ ] **Leading UX**: Implement "Progress Bar" below filters to show real-time album loading status.
- [ ] **Redesign Modal**: Refactor `ViewAlbumModal.js` to mirror "Expanded View" layout (Hero Header, Glassmorphism).

---

## 3. Sprint 12: Future Refactoring (Post-Stabilization)

The "God File" modularization should follow these steps:

1. **State Isolation**: Move filter state and current albums into a `StateController`.
2. **Sub-Component Extraction**:
   - `renderAlbumCard` -> `AlbumCardRenderer.js`
   - `handleFilterChange` -> `FilterManager.js`
3. **Event Bus**: Replace direct re-binding with a simpler event delegation pattern.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All regressions must be cleared in Phase 4 before starting Sprint 12 modularization.

--------------------------------------------------
# Feature Specification: Sprint 11.5 - Stabilization & Ranking Integrity

**Feature Branch**: `feature/sprint11.5-stabilization`  
**Created**: 2025-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Ultimate Goal**: **Total Ranking Integrity**. Ensure every track in every album of a series is accurately ranked (via BestEver, Spotify, or Fallback) to provide a 100% reliable dataset for playlist generation algorithms.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Reliable Album Rankings (Priority: P1)

As a curator, I want to be 100% sure that when I open a "Beatles" album card, I see "Beatles" tracks and not "Led Zeppelin" tracks, so that I can accurately rank and export my playlists.

**Why this priority**: Core value of the app is data accuracy. Bug #71 currently undermines the entire credibility of the multi-source ranking system.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening different album cards in sequence and verifying that the `TracksRankingComparison` component always displays tracks corresponding to the parent card's `album.id`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** Multiple albums in the grid, **When** clicking "Expanded View" on one album and then switching to another, **Then** the ranking table must update instantly with the correct tracks.
2. **Given** View mode toggle (Compact <-> Expanded), **When** toggling views, **Then** all ranking data must remain correctly bound to its respective album card without cross-contamination.

---

### User Story 2 - Consistent Badge Status (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want the "BestEver" badge to accurately reflect if an album has been enriched, so I don't waste time clicking "Enrich" multiple times for the same album.

**Why this priority**: UX clarity and preventing redundant API calls. Bug #58 currently creates confusion about data status.

**Independent Test**: Refresh browser and verify that albums previously enriched with BestEver data still show the correct badge status immediately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** An enriched album, **When** reloading the series, **Then** `bestEverAlbumId` must be present in the store and reflected in the UI badge.

---

### User Story 3 - Predictable Rendering (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want the `AlbumsView.js` state management to be isolated from rendering, so that I can add features without causing side effects in event listeners or data mapping.

**Why this priority**: Crucial for long-term maintainability and solving the "God File" complexity.

**Independent Test**: Unit test the `StateController` to ensure filter updates correctly modify the album list without touching the DOM.

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST ensure `TracksRankingComparison` receives a unique, immutable reference to album tracks keyed by `album.id`.
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist the result of `/enrich-album` (specifically `bestEverAlbumId`) in the Firestore document for the specific series context.
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement a `StateController` to manage `filters` and `currentAlbums` outside of the main view rendering loop.
- **FR-004**: System MUST show a non-blocking loading spinner per-album card while ranking data is being fetched (addressed Issue #70).

### Key Entities

- **AlbumState**: Internal state object containing `currentAlbums`, `activeFilters`, and `loadingStatus`.
- **RankingTableContainer**: Component responsible for fetching and mapping tracks to the correct `album.id`.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 0% incidence of "Wrong Tracks" (#71) after 50 consecutive album view toggles.
- **SC-002**: `AlbumsView.js` line count reduced by at least 15% through extraction.
- **SC-003**: BestEver badges persist across manual page refreshes 100% of the time.

---

## Detailed Review

### 1. `Component.js` (Base Class) ✅
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent

**Strengths**:
- Clean lifecycle pattern (mount → update → unmount)
- Proper error throwing for abstract method
- Props merging is immutable (spread operator)

**No Issues Found**

---

### 2. `SeriesController.js` ⚠️
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⚪⚪ Needs Work

**Issues**:

| # | Severity | Line | Issue | Fix |
|---|----------|------|-------|-----|
| 1 | 🟡 Medium | 13 | **Dead Import**: `albumStore` is imported but never used | Remove or implement |
| 2 | 🟡 Medium | 49-58 | **No View Notification**: `handleSearch`/`handleFilter` update state but don't notify the View | Add callback or event emitter |

**Recommendation**: These are expected for a skeleton, but should be tracked as technical debt.

---

### 3. `SeriesView.js` ✅
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⚪ Good

**Issues**:

| # | Severity | Line | Issue | Fix |
|---|----------|------|-------|-----|
| 1 | 🟢 Low | 8 | **Unused Import**: `Component` is imported but `SeriesView` doesn't extend it | Remove import |

**Strengths**:
- Clean shell rendering
- Proper component mounting
- Mock data is well-structured for testing

---

### 4. `EntityCard.js` 🛑
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⚪⚪ Needs Fixes

**Issues**:

| # | Severity | Line | Issue | Fix |
|---|----------|------|-------|-----|
| 1 | 🔴 **Critical** | 19 | **`container: null`** passed to `super()` will throw error in base Component | Don't call super with null, or make container optional in base |
| 2 | 🟡 Medium | 35 | **XSS Risk**: `title` and `subtitle` are interpolated directly into HTML without escaping | Escape HTML entities |
| 3 | 🟢 Low | 63-68 | **No Event Binding**: Action buttons have no click handlers attached | Add event delegation or direct binding |

**Critical Fix Required**:
```javascript
// Line 19: Change from
super({ container: null, props });

// To (Option A - Make EntityCard not extend Component)
// Or (Option B - Pass a dummy container or make base class handle null)
```

---

### 5. `SeriesGridRenderer.js` ✅
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⚪ Good

**Issues**:

| # | Severity | Line | Issue | Fix |
|---|----------|------|-------|-----|
| 1 | 🟢 Low | 31 | **Hardcoded Type**: `type: 'album'` is fixed, should come from item data | Use `item.type || 'album'` |

**Strengths**:
- Clean separation of grid/list layouts
- Ghost card always appended correctly
- Responsive Tailwind classes

---

### 6. `SeriesHeader.js` ✅
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent

| 1 | 🟢 Low | 50 | **Global Dependency**: Relies on `window.Sortable` | Consider dynamic import |

**Strengths**:
- Proper cleanup in `onUnmount`
- Touch-friendly delay configuration
- Graceful degradation with console.warn

---

### 9. `SkeletonLoader.js` ✅
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent

**Strengths**:
- Clean loop-based generation
- Two variants work well
- Uses Tailwind's `animate-pulse`

**No Issues Found**

---

### 10. `ContextMenu.js` ✅
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⚪ Good

**Issues**:

| # | Severity | Line | Issue | Fix |
|---|----------|------|-------|-----|
| 1 | 🟢 Low | 53 | **No Boundary Check**: Menu can go off-screen if x/y are near edges | Add viewport clipping logic |

**Strengths**:
- Proper click-outside handling with deferred listener
- Clean event cleanup in onUnmount

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Immediate Fixes

### Fix 1: EntityCard Constructor (Critical)
```javascript
// EntityCard.js - Line 18-20
constructor(props) {
    // Don't extend Component if not using container pattern
    this.props = props;
}
```

### Fix 2: Add HTML Escaping Utility
```javascript
// utils/html.js (new file)
export function escapeHTML(str) {
    const div = document.createElement('div');
    div.textContent = str;
    return div.innerHTML;
}
```

### Fix 3: Add Debounce to FilterBar
```javascript
// SeriesFilterBar.js - onMount
const debounce = (fn, delay) => {
    let timeout;
    return (...args) => {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
    };
};

searchInput.addEventListener('input', debounce((e) => {
    this.props.onSearch(e.target.value);
}, 300));
```

---

## ✅ Conclusion

**Overall Architecture Quality**: 🟢 Good

The V3 component system is well-structured with proper separation of concerns. The critical issue in `EntityCard.js` needs fixing before the next sprint milestone. All other issues are minor and can be addressed incrementally.

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Fix `EntityCard.js` constructor issue
2. Add HTML escaping for user-generated content
3. Complete `SeriesController` TODO items
4. Add unit tests for Component lifecycle

# Implementation Plan: V3 Refactor & Componentization

**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Status**: Draft
**Architecture**: Vanilla JS Component-Based (Evolutionary)

---

## 1. Architecture Strategy: "Responsive Componentization"

We are moving from **View-Based** (Monolithic) to **Component-Based** (Modular).
The file `AlbumsView.js` will be **Renamed** to `SeriesView.js` to reflect its true purpose: orchestrating `AlbumSeries`, `ArtistSeries`, and `GenreSeries`.

### 1.1 Design Patterns & Trade-offs
| Pattern | Why we chose it | Alternative Considered | Why Rejected? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Component-Based** | Reusability & Testability ("Lego Blocks"). | **Monolithic View** | Current state; unmaintainable God Class. |
| **MVC (Controller)** | Decouples Logic (`AlbumsController`) from UI. | **MVVM** | Too complex for Vanilla JS without a framework. |
| **Observer (Stores)** | Reactivity without prop drilling. | **Redux** | Overkill for this project size. |
| **Repository** | Data access abstraction (Firestore/Local). | **Direct API Calls** | Harder to test and migrate data sources. |

### 1.1 Component Hierarchy (Target State)
```mermaid
graph TD
    App --> SeriesView[Series View (Orchestrator)]
    
    SeriesView --> SeriesHeader[Series Header (Meta & Actions)]
    SeriesView --> SeriesFilterBar[Filter & Search Bar]
    SeriesView --> SeriesGrid[Series Grid (Responsive)]
    
    SeriesGrid --> EntityCard[Entity Card (Album/Track/Artist)]
    
    SeriesView --> BlendingMenuView[Blending Menu (Full View/Overlay)]
    
    SeriesView --> SeriesController[Series Controller (Logic Only)]
```

### 1.2 "Write Once, Adapt Everywhere"
Components will use CSS Grid/Flex with Tailwind classes to adapt, NOT disparate HTML blocks.
*   **Desktop**: `grid-cols-4`, Hover actions visible.
*   **Mobile**: `grid-cols-1`, Actions via "Three-dot" menu (Touch-friendly).

---

## 2. Feature Component Map (The Refactor "Shopping List")

We must extract these **16 distinct responsibilities** from `AlbumsView.js` (becoming `SeriesView.js`) and other views.

| Feature | Current Logic | Target Component | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grid Rendering** | `renderAlbumsGrid` | `components/series/SeriesGridRenderer.js` | Pure rendering of the grid layout. |
| **Card HTML** | `getAlbumCardTemplate` | `components/series/EntityCard.js` | Generic card for Albums/Artists/Tracks. |
| **Ghost Album** | `renderGhostAlbum` | `components/series/EntityCard.js` | "Add Entity" placeholder logic. |
| **Search/Filter** | `setupSearchListeners` | `components/series/SeriesFilterBar.js` | Input debouncing and sort dropdowns. |
| **Series Meta** | `renderHeader` | `components/series/SeriesHeader.js` | Title, description, and stats display. |
| **Loading State** | `renderSkeletons` | `components/shared/SkeletonLoader.js` | Reusable loading UI. |
| **Drag & Drop** | `initSortable` | `components/series/SeriesDragDrop.js` | SortableJS integration for reordering. |
| **Context Menu** | `handleCardAction` | `components/shared/ContextMenu.js` | "Three-dot" menu actions. |
| **Inventory Grid** | `InventoryView.js` | `components/inventory/InventoryGrid.js` | Reuses `SeriesGridRenderer` with inventory actions. |
| **Playlist Drag** | `PlaylistsView.js` | `components/playlists/PlaylistsDragBoard.js` | Kanban-like drag interface. |
| **Playlist Export** | `PlaylistsView.js` | `components/playlists/PlaylistExportToolbar.js` | Export to Spotify/Apple logic. |
| **Home Carousel** | `HomeView.js` | `components/home/HomeCarousel.js` | Series/Artist/Genre/Track selection flow. |
| **Series Cards** | `HomeView.js` | `components/home/SeriesGrid.js` | Visual cards for Series (replacing list). |
| **Branding** | `TopNav.js` | `components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.js` | Contextual navigation breadcrumbs. |
| **Data Fetching** | `loadSeries` | `controllers/SeriesController.js` | Orchestrating Store interaction. |
| **Event Routing** | `bindEvents` | `controllers/SeriesController.js` | DOM event -> Business Logic mapping. |
| **Blending Menu** | *New Feature* | `components/blending/BlendingMenuView.js` | **Full Screen Overlay** for configuring the mix. |

---

## 3. Data Schemas

### 3.1 RankingContext (The "Blending Menu" Contract)
This object is passed from UI to `CurationEngine`.

```json
{
  "style": "balanced_cascade",  // "deep_cuts", "artist_spotlight"
  "targetDuration": 2700,       // Seconds (45m)
  "parameters": {
    "strictness": 0.8,          // 0.0 - 1.0 (How strict on acclaim?)
    "p1_count": 1,              // Number of "Hits" per album
    "deep_cut_ratio": 0.5       // % of playlist dedicated to deep cuts
  },
  "scope": {
    "type": "series",           // "series" (Album), "artist", "genre", "track"
    "id": "series_123"
  },
  "sources": [
    { "id": "bea", "weight": 1.0 },
    { "id": "spotify", "weight": 0.8 }
  ]
}
```

## 5. Execution Steps

### 5.1 Infrastructure
1.  Create `public/js/components/base/Component.js` (The Interface).
2.  Create `public/js/controllers/AlbumsController.js`.

### 5.2 Extraction (Surgical)
3.  **Step 1**: Extract `AlbumCard` & `AlbumsGridRenderer` (Visuals only).
4.  **Step 2**: Extract `AlbumsFilterBar`.
5.  **Step 3**: Extract `SeriesHeader`.
6.  **Step 4**: Move Logic to `AlbumsController`.

### 5.3 New Features
7.  Implement `BlendingMenuModal`.
8.  Refactor `CurationEngine` to accept `RankingContext`.

### 5.4 Navigation Strategy (Responsive)
*   **Desktop**: Horizontal Top Bar.
    *   `[Logo] [Series Select] | [Albums] [Playlists] [Inventory] | [Create Mix (CTA)] [Profile]`
*   **Mobile**: "App-Like" Shell.
    *   **Top Bar**: `[Logo] [Hamburger Menu]` (Context & Filter).
    *   **Bottom Nav** (Future Sprint) or **Drawer**: For main section switching.
    *   **Create Mix**: Floating Action Button (FAB) or Prominent Header Button in `AlbumsView`.
*   **Implementation**: Refactor `TopNav.js` to use `hidden md:flex` classes and add a Mobile Menu state.

## 6. Verification
*   **Manual**: Verify "Ghost Album" works after Card extraction.
*   **Manual**: Verify Drag & Drop still works on Desktop.
*   **Manual**: Verify Context Menu appears on Mobile tap.

## High-Level Goal
To transition the application from a "God-Class" View architecture to a **Component-Based Architecture**, enabling the implementation of "**The Blending Menu**" (Parametrized Playlist Generation) and ensuring long-term maintainability for the upcoming Mobile App wrapper (Sprint 12).

---

## User Stories & Scenarios

### US1: Developer Sanity (Priority: P0 - Enabler)
As a **Developer**, I want `AlbumsView.js` broken down into small, single-responsibility components so that I can fix bugs and add features without fear of regressions.

*   **Why**: `AlbumsView.js` is currently ~1,800 lines (God Class). It is fragile and blocks "Mobile-First" adaptation.
*   **Success Metrics**: `AlbumsView.js` reduced to < 400 lines. All logic moved to `AlbumsController` or sub-components.

### US2: The "Blending Menu" (Priority: P1)
As a **Curator**, I want to select a mixing style AND configure key parameters so that I can fine-tune the generated playlist to my exact mood.

*   **Entry Points**: I can apply a mix to any active **Series** (`AlbumSeries`, `ArtistSeries`, `GenreSeries`, or `TrackSeries`).
*   **Menu Items**:
    *   **Presets**: "MJRP Balanced" (Default), "Deep Cuts Only", "Hit Parade".
    *   **Parameters**: Target Duration (e.g., 45m, 1h), Strictness (Allow fewer/more deviations), Output Size (Tracks vs Time).
*   **Acceptance Scenarios**:
    *   **Given** I have an active `ArtistSeries` (e.g., Pink Floyd), **When** I click "Create Mix", **Then** the Blending Menu applies the algorithms to that specific series scope.
    *   **Given** I select "Deep Cuts", **When** I increase "Strictness", **Then** the engine filters out popular tracks more aggressively.
    *   **Given** I started via "Artist Spotlight" (Pink Floyd), **When** I click "Create Mix", **Then** the scope is locked to that Artist Context.

### US3: Responsive Dashboard (Priority: P1)
As a **User**, I want the UI to automatically adapt its layout (Grid vs List, Drag vs Touch) based on my device, so that I have an optimal experience on both Desktop and Mobile.

*   **Why**: Current `AlbumsView` uses hacky visibility toggles (`hidden md:block`) and duplicates HTML. We need true responsive components to support the **Sprint 12 (Current)** Capacitor App wrapper.
*   **Acceptance Scenarios**:
    *   **Given** I am on Desktop, **When** I view `AlbumsView`, **Then** I see a 4-column grid with hover actions.
    *   **Given** I am on Mobile, **When** I view `AlbumsView`, **Then** I see a 1-column list with swipe actions or touch-friendly menus.

### US4: Inventory & Playlist Modularization (Priority: P2)
As a **Developer**, I want `InventoryView` and `PlaylistsView` to be composed of the same shared components as `AlbumsView` (e.g., `AlbumCard`, `TrackList`) so that UI fixes apply everywhere instantly.

*   **Why**: Currently, `InventoryView` duplicates card rendering logic from `AlbumsView`. `PlaylistsView` mixes drag-and-drop logic with export logic.
*   **Success Metrics**:
    *   `InventoryView.js` uses strict component composition (no raw HTML strings).
    *   `PlaylistsView.js` delegates Drag & Drop to `PlaylistsDragBoard` component.

### US5: Modern Home Dashboard (Priority: P2)
As a **User**, I want a **Hero Carousel** on the Home Screen so that I can easily start an `AlbumSeries`, `ArtistSeries`, or `GenreSeries`.

*   **Why**: The current static hero only promotes the manual `AlbumSeries` flow. We need to expose the automated Series types visually.
*   **Acceptance Scenarios**:
    *   **Given** I am on Home, **Then** I see 3 slides: "Curate Album Series", "Start Artist Series", "Explore Genre Series".
    *   **Given** I click "Start Artist Series", **Then** I enter an artist name, and the system creates a dynamic `ArtistSeries` containing their discography.

---

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Component Architecture (The "Lego" Blocks)
*   **FR-1.1**: The system MUST implement a lightweight Component base class (Standardized Interface) compatible with Vanilla JS.
    *   **Constraint**: Must implement `mount(container)`, `update(props)`, and `unmount()` lifecycles.
    *   **Future-Proofing**: This specific structure ensures that if we migrate to React or Vue later, we can simply wrap these classes or port the logic 1:1, as the state/lifecycle management will already be decoupled from the DOM.
*   **FR-1.2**: `AlbumsView`, `InventoryView`, `PlaylistsView`, and `HomeView` MUST be decomposed into independently testable components.
    *   **Albums**: `AlbumsGrid`, `AlbumsFilterBar`, `SeriesHeader`, `AlbumsLoadingState`.
    *   **Inventory**: `InventoryGrid` (reuses `AlbumsGrid`), `InventoryStats`.
    *   **Playlists**: `PlaylistsDragBoard`, `PlaylistExportToolbar`.
    *   **Home**: `HomeHero` (Quick Actions), `SeriesGrid` (Rich Cards).
*   **FR-1.3**: Components MUST NEVER access Stores directly. They MUST emit events or call a Controller/Service.

### FR2: The Blending Engine (Parametrization)
*   **Analysis of Current Code**: `curation.js` currently hardcodes bucket logic (P1, P2) and duplicates normalization logic found in `BalancedRankingStrategy.js`.
*   **FR-2.1**: The `CurationEngine` MUST be refactored to accept a `Configuration` object that overrides internal constants (e.g., bucket sizes, target duration) without breaking the existing "MJRP Balanced Cascade" logic.
*   **FR-2.2**: The system MUST define a standard `RankingContext` JSON schema that captures user inputs.

### FR3: AOTY Integration (Preparation)
*   **FR-3.1**: The architecture MUST support plugging in "AlbumOfTheYear.org" as a ranking source (via Interface) without changing the UI code.

---

## Success Criteria

1.  **Code Quality**: `AlbumsView.js` < 400 lines. `InventoryView` and `PlaylistsView` fully componentized.
2.  **No Regression**: All 18 existing Manual Test Cases (Grid, Sort, Drag, Save) pass.
3.  **Parametrization**: The "Blending Menu" successfully generates 3 distinct playlist variations using the new JSON schema.
4.  **Performance**: View switching time < 200ms (Desktop) and < 400ms (Mobile 4G).

## 6. 🗂️ Modal Architecture Analysis (BACKLOG)

> [!NOTE]
> **Added:** 2025-12-22  
> **Priority:** Medium  
> **Status:** Pending Analysis

### Problem Statement
Multiple JS modals exist across the codebase with inconsistent patterns:
- `EditAlbumModal.js`
- `ViewAlbumModal.js`
- `SeriesModals.js`
- `LoginModal.js`
- Various inline modals in views

### Required Analysis
- [ ] **Inventory**: Identify all modal implementations across the codebase
- [ ] **Pattern Assessment**: Evaluate current patterns (class-based, inline HTML, etc.)
- [ ] **Design Pattern**: Propose a unified modal system (e.g., ModalManager, BaseModal class)
- [ ] **Spec Creation**: Create SDD spec for modal refactoring
- [ ] **Implementation Plan**: Define migration path for existing modals

### Potential Benefits
- Consistent open/close behavior
- Unified styling and accessibility
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier to create new modals

# Phase 1.1 Algorithm Analysis Report

**Date**: 2025-12-22  
**Analyst**: Gemini Agent  
**Status**: Analysis Complete

---

## 1. Documentação Encontrada

### ALGORITHM_MENU.md
- **Localização**: `docs/technical/specs/algorithm-strategy/ALGORITHM_MENU.md`
- **Conteúdo**: Especificações completas dos 3 algoritmos existentes
- **Última Atualização**: 2025-12-16 (Sprint 8)

---

## 2. Algoritmos Existentes

| ID | Nome | Status | LOC |
|----|------|--------|-----|
| `legacy-roundrobin` | Legacy Round-Robin | ✅ Implemented | ~130 |
| `s-draft-original` | S-Draft Hybrid Curator Original | ✅ Implemented | ~200 |
| `mjrp-balanced-cascade` | MJRP Balanced Cascade | ⭐ RECOMMENDED | 390 |

---

## 3. Análise do MJRPBalancedCascadeAlgorithm (Recomendado)

### 3.1 Parâmetros Atuais (Hardcoded)

| Parâmetro | Valor | Localização |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `GREATEST_HITS_MAX` | 60 min | Linha 18 |
| `DEEP_CUTS_MAX` | 48 min | Linha 19 |
| `MINIMUM_DURATION` | 30 min | Linha 20 |

### 3.2 Regras do Algoritmo (ALGORITHM_MENU.md)

| Regra | Descrição | Impacto da Mudança |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| GH Content | **SOMENTE rank #1 e #2** | ❌ Quebraria a lógica core |
| GH Max | 60 min | ✅ Já é parâmetro no constructor |
| DC Max | 48 min strict | ✅ Já é parâmetro no constructor |
| numDC | minTracksInAnyAlbum - 2 | ⚠️ Hardcoded na lógica |
| Serpentine | Odd→reverse, Even→forward | ❌ Core do algoritmo |

### 3.3 Potencial de Parametrização

**VIÁVEL PARAMETRIZAR:**
- ✅ `greatestHitsMax` (já aceita no constructor)
- ✅ `deepCutsMax` (já aceita no constructor)
- ✅ `minimumDuration` (já aceita no constructor)
- ✅ `rankingStrategy` (já aceita no constructor via opts)

**NÃO VIÁVEL PARAMETRIZAR (Quebraria regras):**
- ❌ Quantidade de tracks por álbum (hardcoded #1 e #2 para GH)
- ❌ Lógica Serpentine (core do algoritmo)
- ❌ Fórmula numDC = minTracks - 2

---

## 4. Ranking Strategies Existentes

### Infraestrutura JÁ EXISTE!

| Strategy | Localização | Sorting |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `BalancedRankingStrategy` | ranking/BalancedRankingStrategy.js | Multi-factor |
| `SpotifyRankingStrategy` | ranking/SpotifyRankingStrategy.js | **spotifyPopularity DESC** |
| `BEARankingStrategy` | ranking/BEARankingStrategy.js | **rating DESC (BEA)** |

### Uso no MJRP Algorithm

```javascript
// Linha 51 do MJRPBalancedCascadeAlgorithm.js
const strategy = opts.rankingStrategy || new BalancedRankingStrategy()
```

**Conclusão**: O algoritmo JÁ suporta injeção de ranking strategy!

---

## 5. Conclusão e Recomendação

### O que NÃO precisa de refactor:
- ✅ Ranking strategies (Spotify e BEA já existem)
- ✅ Injeção de strategy no algoritmo (já funciona)
- ✅ Parâmetros de duração (já configuráveis)

### O que PRECISA ser criado (Option B):

Os novos algoritmos para o Blending Menu são FUNDAMENTALMENTE DIFERENTES do MJRP:

| Aspecto | MJRP Balanced Cascade | Novos Algoritmos |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|
| Tracks por álbum | Todos (#1 a #N) | **Apenas Top 3 ou Top 5** |
| Ranking source | Balanced (multi-factor) | **Spotify OU BEA** |
| Playlists | GH + Deep Cuts | **Única ou Múltiplas** |
| Complexidade | Alta (Serpentine, Cascade) | **Simples (top N por álbum)** |

### Recomendação Final

> **Option B é a escolha correta.**
>
> Não é viável parametrizar o MJRPBalancedCascadeAlgorithm para os novos casos de uso porque:
> 1. A lógica "Top 3/5 por álbum" é fundamentalmente diferente de "todos os tracks"
> 2. O MJRP foi projetado para usar TODOS os tracks dos álbuns
> 3. Os novos algoritmos devem ser simples (50-100 LOC cada)
>
> **Próximo passo**: Criar 4 novos algoritmos simples que:
> - Estendem BaseAlgorithm
> - Usam SpotifyRankingStrategy ou BEARankingStrategy existentes
> - Selecionam apenas Top 3 ou Top 5 tracks
> - Suportam duração e output configuráveis

## 7. Análise de Modularização

### Arquitetura Atual

```mermaid

    subgraph "Camada de Algoritmos"
        BA[BaseAlgorithm]
        MJRP[MJRPBalancedCascade]
        SD[SDraftOriginal]

        BA --> MJRP
        BA --> SD
        BA --> LRR
    end
    
    subgraph "Camada de Ranking"
        RS[RankingStrategy]
        BRS[BalancedRankingStrategy]
        SPRS[SpotifyRankingStrategy]
        BEARS[BEARankingStrategy]

        REG[algorithms/index.js]
    end
    
    MJRP -.-> BRS
    MJRP -.-> SPRS
    MJRP -.-> BEARS
```

### Oportunidade de Modularização

**PROPOSTA: Criar `TopNAlgorithm` como classe intermediária**

Em vez de criar 4 algoritmos separados com código duplicado, podemos criar:

```mermaid
graph TB
    BA[BaseAlgorithm]
    TNA[TopNAlgorithm]
    T3P[Top3Popular]
    T3A[Top3Acclaimed]
    T5P[Top5Popular]
    T5A[Top5Acclaimed]
    
    BA --> TNA
    TNA --> T3P
    TNA --> T3A
    TNA --> T5P
    TNA --> T5A
```

### TopNAlgorithm - Classe Base Modular

```javascript
// public/js/algorithms/TopNAlgorithm.js (~100 LOC)
export class TopNAlgorithm extends BaseAlgorithm {
    constructor(opts = {}) {
        super(opts)
        this.trackCount = opts.trackCount || 3  // 3 or 5
        this.rankingStrategy = opts.rankingStrategy  // Injected
        this.targetDuration = opts.targetDuration || 45 * 60  // 30m/45m/60m
        this.outputMode = opts.outputMode || 'auto'  // 'single' | 'multiple' | 'auto'
    }

    generate(albums, opts = {}) {
        // 1. Rank tracks using injected strategy
        // 2. Select top N from each album
        // 3. Collect all tracks
        // 4. Divide into playlists based on duration/outputMode
        // 5. Return { playlists, rankingSummary, rankingSources }
    }
    
    // Shared helper methods...
}
```

### Subclasses Mínimas (~20 LOC cada)

```javascript
// Top3PopularAlgorithm.js
export class Top3PopularAlgorithm extends TopNAlgorithm {
    static metadata = {
        id: 'top-3-popular',
        name: 'Crowd Favorites',
        badge: 'TOP 3',
        description: 'Top 3 most-played tracks per album',
        isRecommended: false
    }

    constructor(opts = {}) {
        super({
            ...opts,
            trackCount: 3,
            rankingStrategy: new SpotifyRankingStrategy()
        })
    }
}
```

### Benefícios da Modularização

| Aspecto | Sem Modularização | Com Modularização |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| LOC Total | ~320 (4 × 80) | ~180 (100 + 4 × 20) |
| Manutenção | Alta duplicação | Centralizada em TopNAlgorithm |
| Novos algoritmos | Copiar e colar | Apenas metadata + constructor |
| Testes | 4 arquivos de teste | 1 arquivo core + 4 mínimos |

### Estrutura Final Proposta

```

### Inventário de Algoritmos Existentes

| Algoritmo | LOC | Métodos | Herda de |
|-----------|-----|---------|----------|
| `LegacyRoundRobinAlgorithm` | **519** | 6 métodos | BaseAlgorithm |
| `SDraftOriginalAlgorithm` | **277** | 4 métodos | BaseAlgorithm |
| `MJRPBalancedCascadeV0Algorithm` | **317** | 3 métodos | BaseAlgorithm |

---

### Lógica Compartilhada Identificada (DUPLICADA)

#### 1. `enrichTracks()` - 185 LOC
**Localização**: `LegacyRoundRobinAlgorithm.js` (linhas 211-396)

**Uso atual**:
- `Legacy` → definição original (185 LOC)
- `SDraft` → usa via `this._legacyHelper.enrichTracks(album)` (linha 60)
- `MJRPv0` → usa via `this._legacyHelper.enrichTracks(album)`
- `MJRP` → **NÃO USA** (usa RankingStrategy injetada)

**Problema**: SDraft e MJRPv0 instanciam `LegacyRoundRobinAlgorithm` INTEIRO apenas para usar 1 método.

**Recomendação**: ✅ Extrair para módulo utilitário `trackEnrichment.js`

---

#### 2. `runSwapBalancing()` - ~55 LOC
**Localização**: Duplicado em 2 arquivos

| Arquivo | Linhas |
|---------|--------|
| `LegacyRoundRobinAlgorithm.js` | 460-515 (55 LOC) |
| `SDraftOriginalAlgorithm.js` | 207-261 (54 LOC) |

**Problema**: Código praticamente IDÊNTICO em 2 lugares.

**Recomendação**: ✅ Mover para `BaseAlgorithm.js` ou criar `utils/playlistBalancing.js`

---

#### 3. `isSwapValid()` - ~15 LOC
**Localização**: Duplicado em 2 arquivos

| Arquivo | Linhas |
|---------|--------|
| `LegacyRoundRobinAlgorithm.js` | 436-458 (22 LOC) |
| `SDraftOriginalAlgorithm.js` | 263-273 (10 LOC) |

**Problema**: Lógica similar com pequenas variações.

**Recomendação**: ✅ Mover para `BaseAlgorithm.js` como método protegido

---

#### 4. `distributeSerpentine()` - ~30 LOC
**Localização**: `SDraftOriginalAlgorithm.js` (linhas 169-205)

**Uso atual**:
- `SDraft` → usa diretamente
- `MJRP` e `MJRPv0` → implementam lógica similar inline

**Problema**: MJRP tem serpentine inline em vez de reutilizar.

**Recomendação**: ⚠️ Considerar extrair para `BaseAlgorithm` se mais algoritmos precisarem

---

#### 5. `trimOverDurationPlaylists()` - ~35 LOC
**Localização**: Duplicado em 2 arquivos

| Arquivo | Linhas |
|---------|--------|
| `MJRPBalancedCascadeAlgorithm.js` | 350-385 (35 LOC) |
| `MJRPBalancedCascadeV0Algorithm.js` | 278-313 (35 LOC) |

**Problema**: Código IDÊNTICO.

**Recomendação**: ✅ Extrair para `BaseAlgorithm.js`

### Proposta de Refatoração

#### Fase 1: Modularização Imediata (Alta Prioridade)

| Ação | De | Para | Economia |
|------|-----|------|----------|
| Extrair `enrichTracks` | Legacy | `utils/trackEnrichment.js` | Elimina instância desnecessária |
| Mover `runSwapBalancing` | Legacy/SDraft | `BaseAlgorithm.js` | ~55 LOC |
| Mover `isSwapValid` | Legacy/SDraft | `BaseAlgorithm.js` | ~15 LOC |
| Mover `trimOverDurationPlaylists` | MJRP/MJRPv0 | `BaseAlgorithm.js` | ~35 LOC |

**Economia Total**: ~105 LOC removidos + código mais maintainable

#### Fase 2: Arquitetura Proposta

```
public/js/
├── algorithms/
│   ├── BaseAlgorithm.js           # +runSwapBalancing, +isSwapValid, +trimOverDurationPlaylists

### Precisa Refatorar Agora?

| Questão | Resposta |
|---------|----------|
| Algoritmos existentes funcionam? | ✅ Sim |
| Código duplicado causa bugs? | ❌ Não atualmente |
| Novo desenvolvimento bloqueado? | ❌ Não |
| Vale refatorar para novos algoritmos? | ⚠️ **Decisão do usuário** |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Pergunta para o usuário:**
> 
> Antes de criar os 4 novos algoritmos, você quer que eu:
> 1. **Opção A**: Refatore primeiro os existentes (modularização) e depois crie os novos?
> 2. **Opção B**: Crie os novos algoritmos usando a arquitetura atual e deixe refatoração como task futura?
> 1. Criar `TopNAlgorithm.js` (~100 LOC) com lógica compartilhada
> 2. Criar 4 subclasses mínimas (~20 LOC cada)
> 3. Registrar no `algorithms/index.js`
> 4. Total: ~180 LOC vs ~320 LOC (economia de 44%)

# Background Enrichment Job - Feature Spec

**Created**: 2025-12-23  
**Updated**: 2025-12-23  
**Sprint**: 12 (V3 Architecture)  
**Status**: 🟢 APPROVED

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current State
Albums in the collection may lack Spotify enrichment data (track popularity, Spotify IDs, artwork). This data is required for:
- **Spotify-based ranking** (Top N Popular algorithms)
- **Export to Spotify** functionality
- **Rich metadata display**

Currently, enrichment happens on-demand when viewing an album, which is slow and inconsistent.

### Business Need
Automatically enrich all albums in the background when user connects to Spotify, ensuring data is ready for immediate use in Blending Menu algorithms.

---

## 2. Architecture Decision

### ✅ Storage: **Firestore Only**

| Aspect | Decision | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Primary Storage** | Firestore | Single source of truth |
| **Local Cache** | Firestore offline persistence | Built-in, zero extra code |
| **IndexedDB/localStorage** | ❌ Not used | Avoids ghost data issues |

**Benefits:**
- Single Source of Truth = zero ghost data
- Firestore offline persistence = automatic caching
- Less code (~150 LOC vs ~280 LOC hybrid)
- Lazy cleanup integrated

---

## 3. Anti-Ghost Strategies

### 👻 Ghost Data Prevention

```javascript
// 1. DETERMINISTIC KEYS (prevents duplicates)
function normalizeKey(artist, album) {
    return `${artist}-${album}`
        .toLowerCase()
        .replace(/[^a-z0-9-]/g, '-')
        .replace(/-+/g, '-')
}
// Ex: "The Beatles - Abbey Road" → "the-beatles-abbey-road"

// 2. LAZY CLEANUP (on every read)
async getEnrichment(artist, album) {
    const key = normalizeKey(artist, album)
    const doc = await getDoc(doc(db, 'spotify_enrichment', key))
    
    if (!doc.exists()) return null
    
    const data = doc.data()
    
    // VALIDATION 1: Album still exists in master list?
    const albumExists = await albumLoader.findAlbum(artist, album)
    if (!albumExists) {
        console.log(`[Enrichment] Orphan cleanup: ${key}`)
        await deleteDoc(doc.ref)
        return null
    }
    
    // VALIDATION 2: TTL expired? (re-enrich after 30 days)
    const MAX_AGE_MS = 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 30 days
    if (Date.now() - data.enrichedAt > MAX_AGE_MS) {
        return null // Trigger re-enrichment
    }
    
    // VALIDATION 3: Schema version matches?
    if (data.schemaVersion !== CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION) {
        return null // Re-enrich with new schema
    }
    
    return data
}

// 3. VERSION TRACKING
const CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1
```

### Deletion Scenarios

| Event | Enrichment Action | Reason |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| Remove album from series | **Keep** | May be used by other series |
| Delete entire series | **Keep** | Albums still exist, enrichment is global |
| Remove album from master list | **Lazy Delete** | Cleaned on next access attempt |
| No access for 30+ days | **Re-enrich** | TTL ensures fresh data |

---

## 4. Technical Design

### Firestore Collection: `spotify_enrichment`

```javascript
// Document ID = normalizeKey(artist, album)
// Ex: "the-beatles-abbey-road"

{
    spotifyId: "0ETFjACtuP2ADo6LFhL6HN",
    spotifyPopularity: 85,  // 0-100
    trackPopularity: [
        { title: "Come Together", popularity: 92, uri: "spotify:track:..." },
        { title: "Something", popularity: 87, uri: "spotify:track:..." },
        // ...
    ],
    artworkUrl: "https://i.scdn.co/image/...",
    enrichedAt: 1703354400000,  // timestamp
    schemaVersion: 1
}
```

### New Service: `SpotifyEnrichmentStore.js`

```javascript
import { db } from '../firebase/config.js'
import { doc, getDoc, setDoc, deleteDoc, collection, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore'

const COLLECTION = 'spotify_enrichment'
const CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1
const MAX_AGE_MS = 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 30 days

class SpotifyEnrichmentStore {
    
    // Deterministic key generation
    normalizeKey(artist, album) {
        return `${artist}-${album}`
            .toLowerCase()
            .replace(/[^a-z0-9-]/g, '-')
            .replace(/-+/g, '-')
    }
    
    // GET with lazy cleanup
    async get(artist, album) {
        const key = this.normalizeKey(artist, album)
        const docRef = doc(db, COLLECTION, key)
        const snapshot = await getDoc(docRef)
        
        if (!snapshot.exists()) return null
        
        const data = snapshot.data()
        
        // Lazy validation
        if (!this.isValid(data)) {
            await deleteDoc(docRef)
            return null
        }
        
        return data
    }
    
    // Validation checks
    isValid(data) {
        // TTL check
        if (Date.now() - data.enrichedAt > MAX_AGE_MS) return false
        
        // Schema check
        if (data.schemaVersion !== CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION) return false
        
        return true
    }
    
    // SAVE enrichment
    async save(artist, album, enrichmentData) {
        const key = this.normalizeKey(artist, album)
        await setDoc(doc(db, COLLECTION, key), {
            ...enrichmentData,
            enrichedAt: Date.now(),
            schemaVersion: CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION
        })
    }
    
    // CHECK if enrichment exists and is valid
    async hasValidEnrichment(artist, album) {
        const data = await this.get(artist, album)
        return data !== null
    }
}

export const spotifyEnrichmentStore = new SpotifyEnrichmentStore()
```

### Background Worker: `SpotifyEnrichmentService.js`

```javascript

    constructor() {
        this.queue = []
        this.isRunning = false
        this.completed = 0

        for (const album of albums) {
            const hasValid = await spotifyEnrichmentStore.hasValidEnrichment(
                album.artist, album.title
            )
            if (!hasValid) {
                needsEnrichment.push(album)
            }
        }
        
        return needsEnrichment
    }

    // Process queue with rate limiting
    async processQueue() {
        const BATCH_SIZE = 10
        const DELAY_MS = 100 // 10 req/sec max
        
        while (this.queue.length > 0 && this.isRunning) {
            const batch = this.queue.splice(0, BATCH_SIZE)
            
            for (const album of batch) {
                await this.enrichAlbum(album)
                await this.sleep(DELAY_MS)
            }
        }
        
        this.isRunning = false
        this.notify({ type: 'completed', completed: this.completed, total: this.total })
    }

    // Enrich single album
    async enrichAlbum(album) {
        try {
            const data = await spotifyService.enrichAlbumData(album.artist, album.title)
            if (data) {

        }
    }
    
    // Event subscription
    subscribe(callback) {
        this.listeners.add(callback)
        return () => this.listeners.delete(callback)
    }
    
    notify(event) {
        this.listeners.forEach(cb => cb(event))
    }
    
    sleep(ms) {
        return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))
    }
    
    pause() {
        this.isRunning = false
    }
}

export const spotifyEnrichmentService = new SpotifyEnrichmentService()
```

## 5. Integration Points

| Location | Change |
|----------|--------|
| `SpotifyService.onAuthSuccess()` | Trigger `spotifyEnrichmentService.startEnrichment()` |
| `TopNavComponent` | Show enrichment progress indicator |
| `SpotifyRankingStrategy` | Use `spotifyEnrichmentStore.get()` for popularity data |

---

## 6. UI Design

### Progress Toast
```

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current State
Users can manually generate playlists from a single album series by visiting the series and clicking "Generate Playlist". There's no centralized wizard to:
- Select multiple series as sources
- Configure algorithm parameters
- Preview and generate blended playlists

### Business Need
Provide a streamlined, visually appealing wizard interface that follows the **Restaurant Menu Metaphor** to make playlist generation intuitive and engaging.

---

## 2. Restaurant Metaphor Theme

> 🍹 **"Your Music, Your Recipe"**

| Section | Name | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Step 1 | **🍹 Choose Your Blend** | First select entity type (Album, Artist, Genre, Tracks), then select ONE series for that entity |
| Step 2 | **🍬 Choose Your Flavor** | Select blending algorithm (requires algorithm refactoring) |
| Step 3 | **🥗 Pick Your Ingredients** | Configure parameters (requires ranking/algorithm refactoring) |
| Step 4 | **🎛️ Blend It!** | Preview & Generate (requires algorithm refactoring) |

---

## 3. User Stories

### US1: Series Selection (P0)
> As a **Curator**, I want to select a music entity type (Album, Artist, Genre, or Tracks) and then choose ONE series of that type, so that I can blend the tracks from entities within that series.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Dropdown to select entity type first (Albums, Artists, Genres, Tracks)
- [ ] After entity selection, load available series for that entity type
- [ ] Select ONE series (single selection, not multi-select)
- [ ] Show selected series with visual feedback
- [ ] Blending happens on tracks of entities WITHIN the selected series

### US2: Algorithm Selection (P1)
> As a **Curator**, I want to choose a blending algorithm (flavor), so that I can control how tracks are selected and ordered.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Display available algorithms with user-friendly descriptions (for music lovers, not technical jargon)
- [ ] Visual cards for each algorithm option with clear icons
- [ ] Algorithms should explain in plain language what they do (e.g., "Picks the crowd favorites based on Spotify plays")

> [!NOTE]
> **Requires Algorithm Refactoring**: New algorithms need to be implemented to support this feature.

### US3: Parameter Configuration (P1)
> As a **Curator**, I want to configure playlist parameters, so that I can customize the output.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Duration: Total playlist length (30min, 1hr, 2hr, etc.)
- [ ] Output Mode: Single playlist vs Multiple playlists
- [ ] Number of Playlists (if multiple)
- [ ] Discovery Mode toggle (include unranked tracks)
- [ ] Fair Distribution toggle (equal representation per album)

### US4: Generate & Preview (P0)
> As a **Curator**, I want to preview and generate my playlist(s), so that I can see the result before saving.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] **Dynamic CTA button**: "Blend your `<entity>` Playlist`<s>`!"
  - Entity changes based on selection (Album, Artist, Genre, Track)
  - Plural 's' only appears if multiple playlists
  - Examples: "Blend your Album Playlist!", "Blend your Artist Playlists!"
- [ ] Loading state during generation
- [ ] Preview of generated playlist(s)
- [ ] Save to Spotify / Save Locally buttons

> [!NOTE]
> **Playlist Output**: Reuse existing `PlaylistSeries` code for output management:
> - Drag & Drop reordering
> - Edit functionality
> - Delete capability
> - Save & Export features

| `LegacyRoundRobinAlgorithm` | Round-robin selection | ⚠️ Review |

---

## 8. Success Criteria

1. User can select entity type first, then ONE series to blend
2. User can choose algorithm (flavor) with clear user-friendly descriptions
3. User can configure parameters (ingredients): duration, single/multiple playlists
4. Playlist generation completes without errors
5. Preview shows track list before saving
6. Visual design follows Restaurant Menu Metaphor
7. Dynamic CTA button reflects entity and playlist count

---

## 9. Out of Scope (Phase 1)

- Artist/Genre/Track series views (Coming Soon - routes exist)
- Spotify playlist syncing (beyond basic create)
- AI-powered recommendations
- Cross-entity blending (Albums + Playlists together)

---

## 10. Open Questions - RESOLVED

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Q1: Support cross-entity blending? | **No** - Single entity type per blend |
| Q2: Maximum series to blend? | **1** - Single series selection per blend |
| Q3: Save blend configurations for reuse? | **Deferred** - Phase 2 consideration |

---

## 11. Dependencies & Prerequisites

> [!WARNING]
> **Before implementing Blending Menu UI, the following must be completed:**

1. **Algorithm Analysis & Refactoring**:
   - Analyze existing algorithms for **parametrization potential**
   - Use `MJRPBalancedCascadeAlgorithm` as base (⭐ recommended)
   - Create 4 new algorithms (Top 3/5 Popular/Acclaimed) if parametrization not viable
2. **Ranking System Review**:
   - Spotify ranking: ✅ Available
   - BEA ranking: ✅ Available
   - AOY ranking: ⚠️ **Feasibility analysis required**
3. **CurationEngine Update**: Support new/parametrized algorithm interfaces
4. **PlaylistSeries Integration**: Ensure output can reuse existing playlist management features

- [ ] Test: Background enrichment → navigate to Series → Spotify data visible

---

## ⚠️ Production Deployment Pending

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Added**: 2025-12-23  
> **Priority**: Required before production deploy  
> **Status**: 🟡 PENDING

### Background Enrichment - Global Collection Migration

The `SpotifyEnrichmentStore` currently uses **user-scoped paths** to work with existing Firestore rules:

```
users/{userId}/spotify_enrichment/{albumKey}   ← CURRENT (dev)
```

For **production deployment**, migrate to **global collection** for shared enrichment:

```
spotify_enrichment/{albumKey}   ← TARGET (prod)
```

#### Why?
- **Shared data**: Enrichment for "Abbey Road" benefits ALL users
- **Cost savings**: One enrichment per album, not per user
- **Performance**: New users get pre-enriched data

#### Steps Required

1. **Add Firestore Security Rules** in Firebase Console:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // ... existing rules ...
    
    // Global Spotify Enrichment (any authenticated user can read/write)
    match /spotify_enrichment/{albumKey} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Update SpotifyEnrichmentStore.js**:
   - Remove `getCollectionPath()` method
   - Use `const COLLECTION = 'spotify_enrichment'` directly
   - Remove `userStore` import

3. **Data Migration** (optional):
   - Run one-time migration to copy user-scoped data to global collection
   - Or let natural re-enrichment populate global collection



## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tasks aprovadas. Iniciar execução da Phase 1A (Mixin refactoring)?**

## 2. Opções Arquiteturais

### Opção A: Service-Oriented (Recomendada)

Extrair lógica de negócio para **Services**, manter Views apenas como UI.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Service Layer (NEW)                       │

│    ├── transformTracks(tracks) → normalized                 │
│    └── validate(config) → boolean                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PlaylistPersistenceService.js                               │

         ▲              ▲              ▲
         │              │              │
    ┌────┴────┐    ┌────┴────┐    ┌────┴────┐
    │Blending │    │Playlists│    │ Saved   │
    │MenuView │    │  View   │    │Playlists│
    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
```

**Prós:**
- Single source of truth para lógica
- Fácil testar services isolados
- Views ficam finas (~200-300 LOC cada)

**Contras:**
- Requer refactor significativo
- 2 novos arquivos para manter

---

### Opção B: Component Library

Componentizar UI em componentes reutilizáveis:

```
components/playlists/
├── PlaylistGrid.js          ← Layout grid
├── PlaylistCard.js          ← Card com header + tracks
├── TrackItem.js             ← Track com badges + drag
├── PlaylistSeriesInput.js   ← Nome do batch
├── PlaylistActions.js       ← Botões de ação (delete, export)
├── BatchGroupCard.js        ← Card de grupo na landing
└── DeleteConfirmModal.js    ← Modal de confirmação
```

**Prós:**
- UI consistente
- Componentes testáveis
- Reutilização entre views

**Contras:**
- Não resolve duplicação de lógica
- Mais arquivos para manter

---

### Opção C: Hybrid (Services + Components) ⭐ IDEAL

Combina A + B:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    1. SERVICE LAYER                          │
│  PlaylistGenerationService    PlaylistPersistenceService    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    2. COMPONENT LAYER                        │
│  TrackItem  PlaylistCard  BatchGroupCard  DeleteModal       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    3. VIEW LAYER (Thin Orchestrators)        │
│  SavedPlaylistsView     PlaylistsView     BlendingMenuView  │
│      (~200 LOC)           (~300 LOC)         (~300 LOC)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Prós:**
- Melhor separação de concerns
- Lógica centralizada + UI consistente
- Views viram "wiring" entre services e components
- Mesma abordagem que SeriesView V3

**Contras:**
- Maior investimento inicial
- Mais planejamento necessário

## 4. VIEW REFACTOR PLAN

### 4.1 PlaylistsView.js (Detail)

**Before (896 LOC):**
- Inline generation logic
- Inline track rendering
- Inline Firestore save

**After (~300 LOC):**
```javascript
// PlaylistsView.js
import { PlaylistGenerationService } from '../services/PlaylistGenerationService.js'
import { PlaylistPersistenceService } from '../services/PlaylistPersistenceService.js'
import { RegeneratePanel } from '../components/playlists/RegeneratePanel.js'
import { PlaylistGrid } from '../components/playlists/PlaylistGrid.js'

render() {
  return `
    ${RegeneratePanel.render({ ... })}
    ${PlaylistGrid.render({ playlists })}
    ${ExportSection.render()}
  `
}

async handleRegenerate(config) {
  const genService = new PlaylistGenerationService()
  const result = genService.generate(albums, config)
  
  // Preserve existing IDs
  result.playlists.forEach((p, i) => {
    p.id = this.existingPlaylistIds[i]
  })
  
  // Update store
  playlistsStore.setPlaylists(result.playlists, seriesId)
}

async handleSave() {
  const persistService = new PlaylistPersistenceService(db, cache, userId)
  await persistService.save(seriesId, playlists, batchName, true)
}
```

### 4.2 BlendingMenuView.js

**Before (515 LOC):** Inline generation logic
**After (~300 LOC):** Uses services, components already extracted

### 4.3 SavedPlaylistsView.js

**Before (667 LOC):** Inline rendering, repo calls
**After (~200 LOC):** Uses BatchGroupCard, PersistenceService

---

## 5. VERIFICATION PLAN

### 5.1 Manual UAT Tests

| Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Regenerate preserves IDs** | 1. Edit batch 2. Regenerate 3. Save 4. Check Firestore | Same playlist doc IDs |
| **TrackItem badges** | View any playlist | Orange Acclaim, Green Spotify badges |
| **Drag & Drop** | Drag track between playlists | Track moves, order persists |
| **Export Spotify** | Click Export to Spotify | Opens Spotify modal |
| **Export Apple** | Click Export to Apple | Downloads M3U file |
| **Delete Playlist** | Delete single playlist | Removed from view and Firestore |
| **Delete Batch** | Delete batch | All playlists in batch removed |

### 5.2 Code Review Checklist

- [ ] No inline repository instantiation in views
- [ ] All track rendering uses TrackItem component
- [ ] PlaylistsView < 350 LOC
- [ ] SavedPlaylistsView < 250 LOC
- [ ] BlendingMenuView < 350 LOC
- [ ] Services have JSDoc

---

## 6. IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

```
Phase 1: Services (Logic)
│
├── 1.1 Create PlaylistGenerationService.js
├── 1.2 Create PlaylistPersistenceService.js
├── 1.3 Refactor BlendingMenuView to use services
└── 1.4 Refactor PlaylistsView to use services

Phase 2: Components (UI)
│
├── 2.1 Create TrackItem.js
├── 2.2 Create PlaylistCard.js
├── 2.3 Create PlaylistGrid.js
├── 2.4 Create RegeneratePanel.js (reuses BlendFlavorCard, BlendIngredientsPanel)
├── 2.5 Create BatchGroupCard.js
└── 2.6 Migrate views to use components

Phase 3: Integration & Testing
│
├── 3.1 Update PlaylistsView with RegeneratePanel
├── 3.2 ID preservation logic
├── 3.3 Manual UAT all 13 FR
└── 3.4 LOC count verification (NFR)
```

---

## 7. RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Breaking exports | Test each export after refactor |
| ID mismatch on regenerate | Explicit ID mapping before save |
| Component props drift | TypeScript-like JSDoc for props |

---

## 8. APPROVAL

# Playlist Hybrid Refactor - SDD Spec

**Created**: 2025-12-23 22:08
**Updated**: 2025-12-23 22:29
**Status**: ✅ SPEC APPROVED
**Sprint**: 12.5
**Priority**: High
**Priority**: High
**Architecture**: Option C - Hybrid (Services + Components)

---

## 1. WHAT: Feature Overview

### 1.1 Summary

Refactor Playlist-related functionality using a **Hybrid Architecture** that combines:
1. **Service Layer**: Centralized business logic (generation, persistence)
2. **Component Layer**: Reusable UI components (TrackItem, PlaylistCard)
3. **Thin View Layer**: Views become orchestrators, not logic containers

### 1.2 Scope

**In Scope:**
- Extract `PlaylistGenerationService` (from BlendingMenuView + PlaylistsView)
- Extract `PlaylistPersistenceService` (CRUD operations)
- Create reusable UI components (TrackItem, PlaylistCard, BatchGroupCard)
- Add Playlist Series naming step to BlendingMenu
- Refactor views to use services and components

**Out of Scope:**
- New features (Spotify export remains as-is)
- Navigation changes (SavedPlaylistsView landing behavior unchanged)
- New CRUD operations (only refactoring existing)

---

## 2. WHY: Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Issues

| Issue | Severity | Details |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Duplicated Logic** | 🔴 High | `transformTracks()` in 2 places, 6 LOC each |
| **Duplicated Generation** | 🔴 High | `generatePlaylists()` in 2 places, ~30 LOC each |
| **Inline Repository Calls** | 🟠 Medium | 5 places with `new PlaylistRepository()` |
| **No TrackItem Component** | 🟠 Medium | Track rendering repeated in 2+ views |
| **Missing Batch Naming** | 🟠 Medium | BlendingMenu doesn't prompt for series name |
| **View LOC Bloat** | 🟡 Low | PlaylistsView 896 LOC, SavedPlaylistsView 667 LOC |

### 2.2 Benefits of Refactor

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Single Source of Truth** | Bug fixes apply everywhere automatically |
| **Testability** | Services can be unit tested in isolation |
| **Consistency** | Same TrackItem component across all views |
| **Maintainability** | Views become thin orchestrators (~200-300 LOC) |
| **Alignment** | Matches SeriesView V3 architecture pattern |

---

## 4. ENTITIES AND DATA FLOW

### 4.1 Data Model (Unchanged)

```
Playlist {
  id: string
  name: string
  batchName: string          // Groups playlists together
  tracks: Track[]
  seriesId: string           // Parent series reference
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}

Track {
  id: string
  title: string
  artist: string
  album: string
  duration: number
  rating: number             // Acclaim rating
  rank: number               // Acclaim rank
  spotifyRank: number        // Spotify popularity rank
  spotifyPopularity: number  // 0-100
}
```

### 4.2 Service Interfaces

```typescript
// PlaylistGenerationService
interface PlaylistGenerationService {
  generate(albums: Album[], config: GenerationConfig): GenerationResult
  transformTracks(rawTracks: any[]): Track[]
  validateConfig(config: GenerationConfig): ValidationResult
}

// PlaylistPersistenceService
interface PlaylistPersistenceService {
  save(seriesId: string, playlists: Playlist[], batchName: string): Promise<void>

# Data Schema Architecture Analysis Report

**Date**: 2025-12-24
**Sprint**: 12.5
**Status**: 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

---

## Executive Summary

The application has **multiple inconsistent data schemas** for Albums and Tracks, leading to:
1. Lost ranking data during transformations
2. Missing Spotify fields in some code paths
3. Inconsistent field naming across sources

---

## Current State: Multiple Schema Versions

### 1. API Response Schema (Backend)
```javascript
// From: /api/generate or Apple Music
{
  title, artist, year,
  tracks: [{ title, position, duration, rating, metadata: { spotifyId } }],
  tracksByAcclaim: [{ title, rank, rating, normalizedScore, finalPosition }],
  rankingConsolidated: [...]
}
```
**Missing**: `spotifyPopularity`, `spotifyRank` on individual tracks

---

### 2. Album Model Schema (`public/js/models/Album.js`)
```javascript
class Album {
  id, title, artist, year, coverUrl
  tracks: Track[]              // Ranked order
  tracksOriginalOrder: Track[] // Disc order
  spotifyId, spotifyUrl, spotifyPopularity  // Album-level Spotify
  bestEverAlbumId, bestEverUrl
  acclaim: {}
}
```
**Issues**:
- Spotify data is only at album-level in the model
- Track-level Spotify must be added via enrichment

---

### 3. Track Model Schema (`public/js/models/Track.js`)
```javascript
class Track {
  id, title, artist, album
  duration, rating
  rank      // Acclaim position (1..N)
  position  // Disc track number (1..N)
  metadata: {}
}
```
**MISSING Fields**:
- `spotifyPopularity`
- `spotifyRank`
- `spotifyId`, `spotifyUri`
- `acclaimRank` (explicit)

---

### 4. Spotify Enrichment Schema (`SpotifyEnrichmentHelper.js`)
```javascript
// Applied to tracks:
{
  spotifyPopularity: 0-100,
  spotifyId: "string",
  spotifyUri: "spotify:track:...",
  spotifyRank: 1-N (calculated)
}
```
**Issue**: Only applied to `album.tracks` and `album.tracksOriginalOrder`, but not to newly created tracks by algorithms

---

### 5. Ranking Strategy Output Schema (`BalancedRankingStrategy.js`)
```javascript
// Returns tracks with:
{
  title, artist, album,
  rating, normalizedScore,
  acclaimRank,
  canonicalRank,
  spotifyPopularity,  // IF found in source
  spotifyRank,        // IF found in source
  _rank               // Strategy-assigned position
}
```
**Issue**: Lookup for Spotify data was only in `album.tracks`, not `album.tracksOriginalOrder`

---

### 6. Algorithm Output Schema (`MJRPBalancedCascade.generate()`)
```javascript
// Returns playlist with tracks:
{
  playlists: [{
    title, subtitle, tracks: [{
      id, title, artist, album, duration,
      rating, rank, _rank,
      // MISSING: spotifyRank, spotifyPopularity (depends on enrichment path)
    }]
  }]
}
```

---

### 7. PlaylistGenerationService Output (`transformTracks`)
```javascript
// Sprint 12.5 - transforms algorithm output:
{
  id, title, artist, album, duration, rating,
  rank: t.rank || t.acclaimRank,
  spotifyRank: t.spotifyRank,
  spotifyPopularity: t.spotifyPopularity
}
```
**Issue**: If source track lacks these fields, they become `undefined`

## 🔴 Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Spotify Data Lost During Ranking
**Location**: `BalancedRankingStrategy.rank()`
**Problem**: Was only checking `album.tracks` for Spotify data, missing `tracksOriginalOrder`
**Status**: ✅ FIXED in this session

### Issue 2: Track Model Missing Spotify Fields
**Location**: `public/js/models/Track.js`
**Problem**: Model doesn't declare `spotifyPopularity`, `spotifyRank`, `spotifyId`
**Impact**: Fields are added dynamically, inconsistent across instances

### Issue 3: No Canonical Track Schema
**Problem**: Each component uses slightly different field expectations:
- Algorithms expect: `_rank`, `acclaimRank`, `canonicalRank`
- UI expects: `rank`, `spotifyRank`, `rating`
- Services expect: `spotifyPopularity`

### Issue 4: TrackEnrichmentMixin vs SpotifyEnrichmentHelper
**Problem**: Two places calculate `spotifyRank`:
1. `SpotifyEnrichmentHelper.applySpotifyData()` - on Album load
2. `TrackEnrichmentMixin.enrichTracks()` - during algorithm execution

If timing differs, ranks may be recalculated inconsistently.

---

## Recommended Canonical Track Schema

```javascript
// Proposed: Single Source of Truth for Track
const CanonicalTrack = {
  // Identity
  id: "string",                    // Unique ID
  title: "string",                 // Track name
  artist: "string",                // From album context
  album: "string",                 // From album context

  // Audio
  duration: 0,                     // Seconds

  // Acclaim Ranking (BestEverAlbums / Hybrid Curation)
  acclaimRank: null,               // 1-N position by acclaim
  acclaimScore: null,              // 0-100 normalized rating
  rating: null,                    // Star rating (alias for display)

  // Spotify Ranking
  spotifyRank: null,               // 1-N position by popularity
  spotifyPopularity: null,         // 0-100 from Spotify API
  spotifyId: null,                 // Spotify track ID
  spotifyUri: null,                // spotify:track:...

  // Original Order
  position: null,                  // Disc track number (1..N)
  originAlbumId: null,             // Parent album ID

  // Legacy Compatibility
  rank: null,                      // Alias → acclaimRank OR spotifyRank (based on context)
}
```

---

## Recommended Actions

### Phase 1: Schema Definition (SHORT TERM)
1. Update `Track.js` model to include all Spotify fields
2. Document canonical schema in `docs/technical/canonical_schemas.md`
3. Add JSDoc types for consistency

### Phase 2: Transformation Consolidation (MEDIUM TERM)
1. Create `TrackTransformer.js` as single source of truth for mapping
2. All data sources use TrackTransformer → CanonicalTrack
3. Deprecate scattered `normalizeTrack` functions

### Phase 3: Validation Layer (LONG TERM)
1. Add schema validation at transformation boundaries
2. Log warnings for missing required fields
3. Ensure UI components fail gracefully for missing data

---

## Conclusion

The current architecture has **organic growth** leading to schema drift. The key fix applied in this session (checking `tracksOriginalOrder` for Spotify data) addresses immediate symptoms, but a canonical schema definition is needed for long-term stability.

**Recommendation**: Create a specification document defining the canonical Album and Track schemas, then refactor all transformation points to comply.

## 2. APPLE MUSIC KIT INTEGRATION ANALYSIS

### Current Integration Points

| File | Usage | Critical Fields |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| `client.js:47-143` | Primary album fetch | artworkTemplate → coverUrl |
| `client.js:85-96` | mapTrack() | id, isrc, previewUrl, trackNumber |
| `HomeView.js:446-470` | Discography search | artworkTemplate → coverUrl |
| `PlaylistsExport.js:88` | findTrackFromAlbum | title, artist, album |

### Data Flow from Apple Music Kit

```
MusicKitService.getAlbumDetails(appleId)
    │
    ├── fullAlbum.title, fullAlbum.artist, fullAlbum.year
    ├── fullAlbum.artworkTemplate  → musicKitService.getArtworkUrl(template, 600) → coverUrl
    └── fullAlbum.tracks[]
            ├── t.id (Apple Music track ID)
            ├── t.title
            ├── t.trackNumber
            ├── t.duration
            ├── t.isrc (International Standard Recording Code)
            └── t.previewUrl (30s audio preview)
```

### Fields TrackTransformer MUST Preserve

| Field | Source | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `appleMusicId` | t.id from Apple | Cross-platform matching |
| `isrc` | t.isrc from Apple | Universal track identifier |
| `previewUrl` | t.previewUrl from Apple | Audio preview |
| `trackNumber` | t.trackNumber | Original disc order |

### Fields Album Model MUST Preserve

| Field | Source | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `coverUrl` | musicKitService.getArtworkUrl() | Album artwork display |
| `artworkTemplate` | fullAlbum.artworkTemplate | Resize artwork dynamically |
| `appleMusicId` | fullAlbum.id in metadata.sourceId | Export to Apple Music |

---

## 2.5 EXPORT FLOW ANALYSIS

### Export to Apple Music (`PlaylistsExport.js:39-145`)

**Fields Used Per Track** (lines 85-93):
| Field | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `track.title` | Search query |
| `track.artist` | Search query |
| `track.album` | Album filter + live detection |

**No Changes Needed**: All fields are in CanonicalTrack schema.

### Export to Spotify (`PlaylistsExport.js:152-253`)

**Fields Used Per Track** (lines 195-200):
| Field | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `track.title` ǀ `track.name` | Search query |
| `track.artist` | Search query |
| `track.album` | Search filter |

**No Changes Needed**: All fields are in CanonicalTrack schema. Code already handles fallback `track.title || track.name`.

### Export Safety Summary

✅ **Both exports use only basic identity fields**:
- `title` (with `name` fallback in Spotify)
- `artist`
- `album`

These are the CORE fields and will always be present in CanonicalTrack.

---

## 2.6 INITIAL ALBUM LOADING FLOW (HomeView)

### Flow Sequence

```
HomeView.handleAddAlbum()
    │
    ├── User enters "Artist - Album"
    │
    ▼
apiClient.fetchAlbum({ artist, album })
    │
    ├── MusicKitService.searchAlbums() → Find Apple Music match
    ├── MusicKitService.getAlbumDetails() → Get full album with tracks
    │
    ├── client.js mapTrack() (lines 85-96) ← TrackTransformer.toCanonical() HERE
    │   └── Creates track objects with: id, title, artist, album, isrc, previewUrl, rating
    │
    ├── new Album(albumData) → Model created
    │
    └── applyEnrichmentToAlbum() → Add Spotify data if available
            └── SpotifyEnrichmentHelper.applySpotifyData() ← TrackTransformer.mergeSpotifyData() HERE
```

### Refactor Impact

| Step | Current | After Refactor |
|------|---------|----------------|
| mapTrack (line 85) | Inline mapping | `TrackTransformer.toCanonical()` |
| Album model | Creates Track[] | Creates CanonicalTrack[] |
| Spotify enrichment | applySpotifyData | `TrackTransformer.mergeSpotifyData()` |

---

## 2.7 SPOTIFY BACKGROUND ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS

### Background Job: `SpotifyEnrichmentService` (`app.js:72-87`)

**Trigger**: After Spotify OAuth success
**Purpose**: Pre-enrich ALL albums in user's series with Spotify popularity data

```javascript
// app.js (lines 72-87)
const { spotifyEnrichmentService } = await import('./services/SpotifyEnrichmentService.js')
spotifyEnrichmentService.startEnrichment()
```

### `SpotifyEnrichmentService.enrichAlbum()` (lines 181-223)

**Data Saved to Firestore**:
```javascript
await spotifyEnrichmentStore.save(item.artist, item.album, {
    spotifyId: data.spotifyId,
    spotifyUrl: data.spotifyUrl,
    spotifyPopularity: data.spotifyPopularity,    // Album-level
    spotifyArtwork: data.spotifyArtwork,
    trackPopularity: data.spotifyTracks || []     // Track-level array
})
```

### Refactor Impact

| Component | Current | After Refactor |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `SpotifyEnrichmentService` | Stores raw data | NO CHANGE (stores to Firestore) |
| `SpotifyEnrichmentStore` | CRUD for enrichment | NO CHANGE |
| `SpotifyEnrichmentHelper` | Applies stored data to tracks | Use `TrackTransformer.mergeSpotifyData()` |

✅ **Background job is SAFE**: It only stores data to Firestore, doesn't create Track objects.
The refactor only affects the **consumer** (`SpotifyEnrichmentHelper`) that reads and applies this data.

---

## 3. PROPOSED CHANGES

### 2.1 New File: TrackTransformer.js

```
Path: public/js/transformers/TrackTransformer.js
```

```javascript
/**
 * TrackTransformer - Single Source of Truth for Track Normalization
 * 
 * Converts any raw track data to CanonicalTrack format.
 * Used by: client.js, RankingStrategies, Algorithms, Views
 */

export class TrackTransformer {
  /**
   * Convert raw track to canonical format
   * @param {Object} raw - Raw track from any source
   * @param {Object} context - Album context { artist, album, albumId }
   * @returns {CanonicalTrack}
   */
  static toCanonical(raw, context = {}) {
    return {
      // Identity
      id: raw.id || crypto.randomUUID(),
      title: (raw.title || raw.name || raw.trackTitle || 'Unknown').trim(),
      artist: raw.artist || context.artist || 'Unknown Artist',
      album: raw.album || context.album || context.title || 'Unknown Album',

      // Audio
      duration: Number(raw.duration) || 0,

      // Acclaim (BEA)
      acclaimRank: raw.acclaimRank ?? raw.rank ?? raw.finalPosition ?? null,
      acclaimScore: raw.acclaimScore ?? raw.normalizedScore ?? null,
      rating: raw.rating ?? null,

      // Spotify
      spotifyRank: raw.spotifyRank ?? null,
      spotifyPopularity: raw.spotifyPopularity ?? raw.popularity ?? null,
      spotifyId: raw.spotifyId ?? raw.metadata?.spotifyId ?? null,
      spotifyUri: raw.spotifyUri ?? null,

      // Original Order
      position: raw.position ?? raw.trackNumber ?? null,
      originAlbumId: raw.originAlbumId ?? context.albumId ?? null,

      // Preserve metadata
      metadata: { ...raw.metadata }
    }
  }

  /**
   * Merge Spotify enrichment into existing track
   */
  static mergeSpotifyData(track, spotifyData) {
    return {
      ...track,
      spotifyRank: spotifyData.spotifyRank ?? track.spotifyRank,
      spotifyPopularity: spotifyData.spotifyPopularity ?? track.spotifyPopularity,
      spotifyId: spotifyData.spotifyId ?? track.spotifyId,
      spotifyUri: spotifyData.spotifyUri ?? track.spotifyUri
    }
  }

  /**
   * Calculate spotifyRank for a list of tracks by popularity
   */
  static calculateSpotifyRanks(tracks) {
    const withPop = tracks.filter(t => t.spotifyPopularity != null)
    const sorted = [...withPop].sort((a, b) => b.spotifyPopularity - a.spotifyPopularity)
    
    sorted.forEach((track, idx) => {
      track.spotifyRank = idx + 1
    })
    
    return tracks
  }
}
```

### 2.2 Update: Track.js Model

#### [MODIFY] [Track.js](file:///c:/Users/Mauricio%20Pedroso/VibeCoding/MyProjects/MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0/public/js/models/Track.js)

Add explicit Spotify and Acclaim fields with JSDoc:

```javascript
/**
 * @typedef {Object} Track
 * @property {string} id - Unique identifier
 * @property {string} title - Track title
 * @property {string} artist - Artist name (from album context)
 * @property {string} album - Album title (from album context)
 * @property {number} duration - Duration in seconds
 * 
 * @property {number|null} acclaimRank - Position by BEA/Acclaim (1-N)
 * @property {number|null} acclaimScore - Normalized score 0-100
 * @property {number|null} rating - Star rating (alias for display)
 * 
 * @property {number|null} spotifyRank - Position by Spotify popularity (1-N)
 * @property {number|null} spotifyPopularity - Spotify popularity 0-100
 * @property {string|null} spotifyId - Spotify track ID
 * @property {string|null} spotifyUri - spotify:track:...
 * 
 * @property {number|null} position - Original disc track number
 * @property {string|null} originAlbumId - Parent album ID
 */
```

### 2.3 Refactor: Integration Points

| File | Change | LOC Impact |
|------|--------|------------|
| `client.js` | Use `TrackTransformer.toCanonical()` in normalize | -20, +5 |
| `BalancedRankingStrategy.js` | Use `TrackTransformer` for enrichment | -30, +10 |
| `SpotifyRankingStrategy.js` | Inherit from updated Balanced | 0 |
| `BEARankingStrategy.js` | Inherit from updated Balanced | 0 |
| `TrackEnrichmentMixin.js` | Use `TrackTransformer.toCanonical()` | -40, +15 |
| `SpotifyEnrichmentHelper.js` | Use `TrackTransformer.mergeSpotifyData()` | -20, +5 |
| `PlaylistGenerationService.js` | Use `TrackTransformer.toCanonical()` | -10, +5 |
| `PlaylistsView.js` | No change (uses TrackItem) | 0 |
| `TrackItem.js` | No change (reads canonical fields) | 0 |

## 4. VERIFICATION PLAN

### 4.1 Manual UAT Checklist (Full Regression)

After implementation, test ALL views:

| # | View | Test | Expected | Owner |
|---|------|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | HomeView | Add album "Artist - Album" | Album loads with cover | Agent (mock) |
| 2 | HomeView | Connect Spotify → Enrichment starts | Background job runs | User |
| 3 | BlendingMenuView | Generate with Balanced Cascade | Playlists created | Agent |
| 4 | BlendingMenuView | Generate with Crowd Favorites | Playlists ordered by Spotify | Agent |
| 5 | PlaylistsView | Verify dual badges | Orange Acclaim + Green Spotify | Agent |
| 6 | PlaylistsView | Save to History | Saves without error | Agent |
| 7 | PlaylistsView | Export to Spotify | Tracks found and exported | **User** |
| 8 | PlaylistsView | Export to Apple Music | Tracks found and exported | **User** |
| 9 | PlaylistsView | Download JSON | Valid JSON with all fields | Agent |
| 10 | SavedPlaylistsView | Load saved batch | Displays correctly | Agent |
| 11 | SavedPlaylistsView | Edit batch | Opens in edit mode | Agent |
| 12 | SavedPlaylistsView | Delete batch | Removes correctly | Agent |
| 13 | SeriesView | Album cards display | Correct artwork, tracks count | Agent |
| 14 | RankingView | Dual tracklist display | Original vs Ranked order | Agent |
| 15 | InventoryView | Album list | All albums with covers | Agent |

### 4.2 Agent Mock Tests

I can validate the following **without Spotify/Apple credentials**:

| Test | Method |
|------|--------|
| TrackTransformer produces canonical output | Console log validation |
| Dual badges render (with mock data) | DOM inspection |
| JSON export contains all fields | Download and parse |
| No console errors on navigation | Browser console check |

### 4.3 User-Required Tests (Real Credentials)

These tests require **you** to run them with real Spotify/Apple accounts:

| Test | Steps |
|------|-------|
| Export to Spotify | Click export → Check Spotify app |
| Export to Apple Music | Click export → Check Apple Music |
| Connect Spotify triggers enrichment | Connect → Check console for `[EnrichmentService]` logs |
| Spotify badges appear after enrichment | After enrichment completes, reload → Check green badges |

### 4.2 Console Verification

Run the app and verify:
- [ ] No console errors on any view
- [ ] `[TrackTransformer]` logs show consistent output

### 4.3 Build Verification

```bash
npm run dev
# Verify no build errors
```

# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\sprint12-architecture-v3.0\playlists-refactor\data-schema-refactor\spec.md
--------------------------------------------------
# Data Schema Canonical Refactor - Specification

**Created**: 2025-12-24
**Status**: ✅ APPROVED
**Sprint**: 12.5 (Sub-task of Playlist Hybrid Refactor)
**SDD Phase**: 1 - Specification (COMPLETE)

---

## 1. WHAT (Problem Statement)

### Current State

The application has **multiple inconsistent data schemas** for Albums and Tracks, created organically over sprints 1-12. This leads to:

1. **Lost ranking data** during transformations
2. **Missing Spotify fields** in some code paths
3. **Inconsistent field naming** across sources
4. **Dual enrichment logic** in different modules

### Evidence

| Issue | Location | Impact |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Spotify data lost | `BalancedRankingStrategy` only checked `album.tracks` | Green badges never appear |
| Track model incomplete | `Track.js` lacks Spotify fields | Fields added dynamically, inconsistent |
| Multiple normalize functions | `client.js`, `albumsStore`, `PlaylistsView` | Each normalizes differently |
| Dual spotifyRank calculation | `SpotifyEnrichmentHelper` AND `TrackEnrichmentMixin` | Inconsistent ranks |

---

## 2. WHY (Goals)

### Primary Goals

| ID | Goal | Benefit |
|----|------|---------|
| G-1 | Define **canonical Album schema** | Single source of truth |
| G-2 | Define **canonical Track schema** | All fields explicitly declared |
| G-3 | Create **single normalization point** | Eliminates drift |
| G-4 | Ensure **Spotify data flows end-to-end** | Badges work correctly, algorithms using Spotify ranking sort correctly |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Track fields explicitly defined | 100% in model |
| Normalization functions | Single `TrackTransformer.js` |
| Green Spotify badge visible | Whenever Spotify data is available for track |
| Full regression test pass | All views display correctly |

---

## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope

1. **Album Model** (`Album.js`) - Add missing fields, JSDoc
2. **Track Model** (`Track.js`) - Add Spotify fields, JSDoc
3. **TrackTransformer** - New single source for track mapping
4. **RankingStrategy** - Use TrackTransformer
5. **Algorithm Mixins** - Use TrackTransformer
6. **PlaylistGenerationService** - Use TrackTransformer
7. **Views** - Verify all tracks render correctly

### Out of Scope

- Backend API changes (data comes as-is)
- Firestore schema migration
- New features (purely refactor)

---

## 6. DATA CONTEXT

### Current Schema Locations

| File | Purpose | Fields Defined |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `models/Album.js` | Album domain model | id, title, artist, tracks[], spotifyId |
| `models/Track.js` | Track domain model | id, title, artist, album, rank, rating |
| `helpers/SpotifyEnrichmentHelper.js` | Adds Spotify data | spotifyPopularity, spotifyRank |
| `algorithms/mixins/TrackEnrichmentMixin.js` | Enriches during generation | acclaimRank, canonicalRank, spotifyRank |

### Proposed Canonical Track Schema

```javascript
// CanonicalTrack - to be formalized in Track.js
{
  // Identity
  id: string,
  title: string,
  artist: string,
  album: string,

  // Audio
  duration: number (seconds),

  // Acclaim (BestEverAlbums)
  acclaimRank: number | null,     // 1-N
  acclaimScore: number | null,    // 0-100
  rating: number | null,          // Star rating (alias)

  // Spotify
  spotifyRank: number | null,     // 1-N
  spotifyPopularity: number | null, // 0-100
  spotifyId: string | null,
  spotifyUri: string | null,

  // Apple Music Kit
  appleMusicId: string | null,    // Apple Music track ID

# Data Schema Canonical Refactor - Tasks

**Created**: 2025-12-24
**Status**: ✅ APPROVED - IN PROGRESS
**Sprint**: 12.5 (Sub-task of Playlist Hybrid Refactor)
**SDD Phase**: 3 - Tasking (COMPLETE)
**Depends on**: spec.md ✅, plan.md ✅

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (TrackTransformer + Model Updates)

### 1.1 Create TrackTransformer.js
- [x] Create `public/js/transformers/` directory
- [x] Create `TrackTransformer.js` with:
  - [x] `toCanonical(raw, context)` - main transformation
  - [x] `mergeSpotifyData(track, spotifyData)` - Spotify enrichment
  - [x] `calculateSpotifyRanks(tracks)` - rank by popularity
- [x] Export as ES module
- [x] **FR-3**: Verify produces canonical output from any source

### 1.2 Update Track.js Model
- [x] Add JSDoc typedef for CanonicalTrack
- [x] Add explicit properties:
  - [x] `acclaimRank`, `acclaimScore`
  - [x] `spotifyRank`, `spotifyPopularity`, `spotifyId`, `spotifyUri`
  - [x] `appleMusicId`, `isrc`, `previewUrl`
- [x] **FR-1**: Spotify fields declared
- [x] **FR-2**: Acclaim fields declared

### 1.3 Create Barrel Export
- [x] Create `public/js/transformers/index.js`
- [x] Export TrackTransformer

---

## Phase 2: Consumer Refactoring

### 2.1 Refactor client.js (Initial Album Loading)
- [x] Import TrackTransformer
- [x] Replace inline `mapTrack()` (lines 85-96) with `TrackTransformer.toCanonical()`
- [x] Verify album context (`artist`, `album`) passed correctly
- [x] **FR-13**: Initial loading uses TrackTransformer

### 2.2 Refactor SpotifyEnrichmentHelper.js
- [x] Import TrackTransformer
- [x] Replace `applySpotifyData()` track mutation with `TrackTransformer.mergeSpotifyData()`
- [x] Replace `spotifyRank` calculation with `TrackTransformer.calculateSpotifyRanks()`
- [x] **FR-14**: Background enrichment continues working

### 2.3 Refactor BalancedRankingStrategy.js
- [x] Import TrackTransformer (not required - already working)
- [x] Use `TrackTransformer.toCanonical()` for track enrichment in `rank()`
- [x] Verify `spotifyPopularity` lookup from both `tracks` and `tracksOriginalOrder`
- [x] **FR-4**: RankingStrategy uses TrackTransformer

### 2.4 Refactor TrackEnrichmentMixin.js
- [x] Import TrackTransformer (dynamic)
- [x] Use `TrackTransformer.toCanonical()` in `enrichTracks()`
- [x] Remove duplicate `spotifyRank` calculation (defer to TrackTransformer)
- [x] **FR-5**: Algorithms preserve Spotify data

### 2.5 Refactor PlaylistGenerationService.js
- [x] Import TrackTransformer
- [x] Use `TrackTransformer.toCanonical()` in `transformTracks()`
- [x] Verify all canonical fields preserved in output

---

## Phase 3: Verification (Agent Tests)

### 3.1 Build Verification
- [x] Run `npm run dev`
- [x] Verify no build errors
- [x] Verify no missing imports

### 3.2 Console Verification
- [x] Navigate to all views
- [x] **NFR-2**: Zero console errors

### 3.3 Agent Mock Tests
- [x] HomeView: Add album loads with cover (**FR-9**)
- [x] BlendingMenuView: Generate with Balanced Cascade (**FR-5**)
- [x] BlendingMenuView: Generate with Crowd Favorites (**FR-8**)
- [x] PlaylistsView: Verify dual badges (**FR-6**)

- [x] PlaylistsView: Download JSON (**FR-11**, **FR-12** fields present)
- [x] SavedPlaylistsView: Load saved batch (**FR-10**)
- [x] SavedPlaylistsView: Edit batch (**FR-10**)
- [x] SavedPlaylistsView: Delete batch (**FR-10**)
- [x] SeriesView: Album cards display (**FR-7**, **FR-9**)
- [x] RankingView: Dual tracklist display
- [x] InventoryView: Album list (**FR-7**)

---

## Phase 4: User Verification (Real Credentials)

> **Note**: These tests require user with real Spotify/Apple accounts.

### 4.1 Spotify Integration
- [x] Connect Spotify triggers enrichment (**FR-14**)
- [x] Spotify badges appear after enrichment (**FR-6**, **FR-7**)
- [x] Export to Spotify works (**FR-12**)

# TopNav v2 - Implementation Plan

**Created**: 2025-12-22  
**Status**: ✅ APPROVED  
**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

---

## Goal

Redesign TopNav to consolidate Series navigation under a dropdown and add "The Blending Menu" as a first-level nav item.

---

## Proposed Changes

### Overview

| Component | Action | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `TopNav.js` | MODIFY | Add dropdown for Series, restructure nav items |
| `SeriesDropdown.js` | NEW | Dedicated component for dropdown logic |
| `router.js` | MODIFY | Add routes for /blend, /artists, /genres, /tracks |
| `neon.css` | MODIFY | Ensure dropdown uses existing glow effects |

---

### Component 1: TopNav.js

#### [MODIFY] [TopNav.js](file:///c:/Users/Mauricio%20Pedroso/VibeCoding/MyProjects/MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0/public/js/components/TopNav.js)

**Changes:**
1. Replace separate nav links with new structure:
   - `Home` → `/home`
   - `Series ▼` → dropdown
   - `The Blending Menu` → `/blend`
   - `Inventory` → `/inventory`

2. Add dropdown state management:
   ```javascript
   this.isSeriesDropdownOpen = false
   ```

3. Render dropdown menu with entity types:
   - Albums → `/albums`
   - Artists → `/artists` (disabled/coming soon)
   - Genres → `/genres` (disabled/coming soon)
   - Tracks → `/tracks` (disabled/coming soon)
   - Playlists → `/playlist-series`

4. Close dropdown on:
   - Click outside
   - Navigation selection

---

### Component 2: SeriesDropdown.js (Optional)

#### [NEW] [SeriesDropdown.js](file:///c:/Users/Mauricio%20Pedroso/VibeCoding/MyProjects/MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0/public/js/components/navigation/SeriesDropdown.js)

**Responsibility:**
- Render dropdown UI
- Handle open/close state
- Emit navigation events

**Interface:**
```javascript
class SeriesDropdown {
  constructor({ onNavigate, currentPath })
  render() // Returns HTML string
  open()
  close()
  isOpen() // Returns boolean
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> This component is optional. If TopNav is already manageable, we can keep dropdown logic inline.

---

### Component 3: Router Updates

#### [MODIFY] [router.js](file:///c:/Users/Mauricio%20Pedroso/VibeCoding/MyProjects/MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0/public/js/router.js)

**Add Routes:**
```javascript
{ path: '/blend', view: BlendingMenuView },
{ path: '/artists', view: ComingSoonView }, // Placeholder
{ path: '/genres', view: ComingSoonView },  // Placeholder
{ path: '/tracks', view: ComingSoonView },  // Placeholder
```

---

### Mobile Drawer Updates

Update mobile drawer in TopNav.js:
1. Replace flat nav with expandable "Series" section
2. Add "The Blending Menu" item
3. Maintain same entity type options

---

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- N/A (manual verification for UI)

### Manual Verification
1. Desktop: Click Series dropdown → verify all options visible
2. Desktop: Click outside dropdown → verify closes
3. Desktop: Click nav item → verify navigation works
4. Mobile: Open drawer → verify Series expandable section
5. Mobile: Navigate → verify drawer closes

---

## Implementation Order

| Step | Task | Est. Time |
|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Add `/blend` route + placeholder view | 15 min |
| 2 | Modify TopNav.js render() with new structure | 30 min |
| 3 | Add dropdown toggle logic + close-on-outside | 20 min |
| 4 | Update mobile drawer with Series expansion | 20 min |
| 5 | Test all navigation paths | 15 min |
| 6 | Polish: CSS refinements | 10 min |

**Total Estimate:** ~2 hours

---

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please review this implementation plan:
> 1. Do you want SeriesDropdown as a separate component or inline in TopNav?
> 2. Should disabled entities (Artists, Genres, Tracks) show as "Coming Soon" or be hidden?
> 3. Proceed with implementation?



# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\sprint12-architecture-v3.0\topnav-redesign\spec.md
--------------------------------------------------
# Feature Specification: TopNav Redesign

**Feature**: TopNav v2 - Series Navigation & The Blending Menu  
**Created**: 2025-12-22  
**Status**: ✅ APPROVED  
**Sprint**: 12 (V3 Architecture)  
**Sprint**: 12 (V3 Architecture)  
**Relates To**: [sprint12-architecture-v3.0](../sprint12-architecture-v3.0/spec.md)

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current State
The TopNav has separate links for "Album Series", "Playlists", and "Inventory". As we expand to support multiple entity types (Artists, Genres, Tracks, Playlists), we need a unified "Series" dropdown.

### Issues
1. **Fragmented Navigation**: Series types scattered across menu
2. **No Blending Menu Entry Point**: The Blending Menu feature needs a prominent nav item
3. **Scalability**: Adding new entity types requires modifying nav structure

---

## 2. Business Goals

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **G1** | Consolidate all series types under one dropdown |
| **G2** | Add "The Blending Menu" as a first-level nav item |
| **G3** | Keep "Inventory" as a standalone item |
| **G4** | Support Desktop and Mobile responsive layouts |

---

## 3. User Stories

### US1: Series Type Navigation (P0)
> As a **Curator**, I want a single "Series" dropdown with all entity types, so that I can easily switch between different series views.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Dropdown labeled "Series" in main nav
- [ ] Options: Albums (default), Artists, Genres, Tracks, Playlists
- [ ] Active entity type is highlighted
- [ ] Clicking an option navigates to that series view

### US2: The Blending Menu Navigation (P1)
> As a **Curator**, I want "The Blending Menu" as a main navigation item, so that I can access playlist generation tools.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] "The Blending Menu" appears as first-level nav item
- [ ] Clicking opens the Blending Menu view/overlay

---

## 4. Proposed Navigation Structure

## 4.1 Routes & Landing Pages

| Nav Item | Route | Landing Page | View Component | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| **Home** | `/home` | Dashboard with stats | `HomeView` | ✅ Exists |
| **Series > Albums** | `/albums` | Album series grid | `SeriesView` | ✅ Exists |
| **Series > Artists** | `/artists` | Artist series grid | `ArtistSeriesView` | ⬜ TODO |
| **Series > Genres** | `/genres` | Genre series grid | `GenreSeriesView` | ⬜ TODO |
| **Series > Tracks** | `/tracks` | Track series grid | `TrackSeriesView` | ⬜ TODO |
| **Series > Playlists** | `/playlist-series` | Playlist series grid | `PlaylistsView` | ✅ Exists |
| **The Blending Menu** | `/blend` | Blend configuration | `BlendingMenuView` | ⬜ TODO |
| **Inventory** | `/inventory` | All albums collection | `InventoryView` | ✅ Exists |

### Landing Page Concepts

#### Home (`/home`)
- Stats overview (total albums, series, playlists)
- Quick access tiles to recent series
- **Album-focused**: Primary loading/creation flow for Album Series (keeps current emphasis)
- "Create Album Series" prominent CTA

#### Series Pages (`/albums`, `/artists`, `/genres`, `/tracks`, `/playlist-series`)
- Grid of series for that entity type
- Search/Filter toolbar
- Create new series CTA
- Click series → drill into detail view

#### The Blending Menu (`/blend`)

> **Restaurant Metaphor Theme**

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **🍹 Choose Your Blend** | Select series to blend - dropdown/filter by entity type, then loads series for that entity |
| **🍬 Choose Your Flavor** | Select algorithm/blending mode |
| **🥗 Pick Your Ingredients** | Parameters: duration, single/multiple playlists, # of playlists, discover mode, etc. |
| **🎛️ Blend It!** | CTA button: "Generate Your Playlist(s)" |

#### Inventory (`/inventory`)
- Full album collection (not in any series)
- Import/Export tools
- Data management

> [!WARNING]
> **Known Issues to Fix:**
> 1. Calculations not working properly
> 2. **Owned/Not Owned Bug**: New items should default to "not owned" but are coming as "owned". User should select which albums they own.

---

## 5. Design Principles & Available CSS

### Existing CSS Classes to Use

| Effect | CSS Class | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Glassmorphism** | `.glass-panel` | `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`, dark bg, subtle border |
| **Navigation Glow** | `.nav-link-glow` | Orange glow on hover with `text-shadow` |
| **Flame/Orange Border** | `.neon-border-orange` | Orange border with `box-shadow` glow |
| **Tech Button** | `.tech-btn-primary` | Orange gradient, glow on hover |
| **Tech Panel** | `.tech-panel` | Chamfered look, backdrop blur |

### Implementation

| Element | Classes |
|---------|---------|
| Dropdown Panel | `glass-panel rounded-xl` |
| Active Nav Item | `nav-link-glow text-accent-primary` |
| Hover Effect | `nav-link-glow:hover` (orange glow + text-shadow) |
| Dropdown Items | `hover:bg-white/5 transition-all duration-200` |
| Separator | `border-t border-white/10` |

---

## 6. Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**: All 5 series types accessible from dropdown
2. **Visual Consistency**: Matches existing glass-panel design
3. **Responsive**: Works on Desktop (≥768px) and Mobile (<768px)
4. **Performance**: Client-side routing, no page reloads

---

## 7. Out of Scope

- The Blending Menu implementation (separate feature)
- Artist/Genre/Track Series views (requires routes first)

---

## 8. Open Questions - RESOLVED

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Q1**: Dropdown closes on click outside or only on selection? | **Closes on click outside** |
| **Q2**: Show entity counts in dropdown (e.g., "Albums (3)")? | **No** |

---

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please review this updated navigation structure:
> - **Series ▼** = dropdown with Albums, Artists, Genres, Tracks, Playlists
> - **The Blending Menu** = first-level nav item
> - **Inventory** = first-level nav item

# Album Data Pipeline - Architectural Analysis

**Created**: 2025-12-25
**Related Issues**: #92 (Album Cache/Display), #93 (Reconfigure Panel)
**Sprint**: 13 (Part of ARCH-2 Refactoring)

---

## Executive Summary

Investigation of bugs #92 and #93 revealed fundamental architectural flaws in how album data flows through the application. The current design has **3 interlinked problems** that cause wrong albums to appear in series and configuration to be lost.

---

## Current Architecture (Problematic)

    E --> I
```

---

## Problem Analysis

### Problem 1: Cache Key ≠ Album Identity

**Location**: `public/js/api/client.js` lines 48-54, `public/js/cache/albumCache.js`

```javascript
// client.js - fetchAlbum()
const appleAlbums = await musicKitService.searchAlbums(artist, albumName, 5)
const selected = appleAlbums[0]  // ← May be a DIFFERENT album!
// ...later...
this.cache.set(query, album)  // ← Caches with ORIGINAL query, not actual album

// albumCache.js - set()
set(query, album) {
    this.memoryCache.set(query, album)  // ← Key is query, value may be different album
}
```

**Example**:
| Query | Apple Music Returns | Cached As |
|-------|---------------------|-----------|
| `"Jimmy Page & Robert Plant - No Quarter"` | `"Physical Graffiti (Remastered)"` | `{ key: "jimmy_page_robert_plant_no_quarter", album: "Physical Graffiti" }` |

**Impact**: When series loads albums by query, it gets wrong album data.

---

### Problem 2: No Validation of Search Results

**Location**: `public/js/api/client.js` lines 48-58

```javascript
if (appleAlbums && appleAlbums.length > 0) {
    const selected = appleAlbums[0]  // ← No similarity check!
    // Proceeds to cache and use this album
}
```

Apple Music search is fuzzy. Searching for `"Robert Plant & Jimmy Page - Walking Into Clarksdale"` returns Led Zeppelin albums because:
1. Apple Music may not have that album
2. Or it's listed as `"Page and Plant"` (artist name variation)
3. The search returns related popular albums by same artists

---

### Problem 3: AlbumsStore Global Pollution

**Location**: `public/js/stores/albums.js`

While `albumsStore` has `albumsByAlbumSeriesId`, the bug occurs because:
1. `PlaylistsController` loads albums for editing
2. Albums are fetched via `apiClient.fetchMultipleAlbums(queries)`
3. Each album is added to store
4. If album title ≠ originally stored title, a "new" album is created
5. This "new" album has no series association → becomes "uncategorized"

---

## Proposed Refactoring

### Solution 1: Album Identity Model

Create a stable identity for albums that survives cache/API round-trips.

```javascript
// NEW: public/js/models/AlbumIdentity.js
export class AlbumIdentity {
    constructor(originalQuery, resolvedAlbum) {
        this.originalQuery = originalQuery  // What user saved
        this.resolvedTitle = resolvedAlbum.title
        this.resolvedArtist = resolvedAlbum.artist
        this.appleId = resolvedAlbum.appleId
        this.spotifyId = resolvedAlbum.spotifyId
        this.matchConfidence = this.calculateConfidence()
    }
    
    calculateConfidence() {
        // Compare originalQuery vs resolved title+artist
        // Return 0-1 score
    }
    
    isValid() {
        return this.matchConfidence >= 0.4  // Threshold
    }
}
```

---

### Solution 2: Cache Key Normalization

Cache by **result identity**, not query.

```javascript
// CHANGE: albumCache.set()
set(query, album) {
    // Generate key from ACTUAL album, not query
    const albumKey = this.getAlbumKey(album)  // Uses title + artist
    
    // Store mapping: query → albumKey (for lookups)
    this.queryToAlbumKey.set(query, albumKey)
    
    // Store album data
    this.memoryCache.set(albumKey, album)
}

getAlbumKey(album) {
    const normalized = `${album.artist}_${album.title}`
        .toLowerCase()
        .replace(/\s+/g, '_')
        .replace(/[^\w-]/g, '')
    return `album_${normalized}`
}
```

---

### Solution 3: Validation Before Caching

Reject low-confidence matches in `apiClient.fetchAlbum()`.

```javascript
// CHANGE: client.js - fetchAlbum()
const selected = appleAlbums[0]
const similarity = calculateSimilarity(albumName, selected.attributes.name)

if (similarity < 0.35) {
    console.warn(`[APIClient] Rejected "${selected.attributes.name}" - ${similarity*100}% match to "${albumName}"`)
    return this._fetchAlbumFromLegacyAPI(query)  // Fallback
}

// Only cache if confident match
this.cache.set(query, album)
```

---

### Solution 4: Series-Scoped Album Loading

Ensure `PlaylistsController` only uses albums from the correct series.

```javascript
// CHANGE: PlaylistsController.loadAlbumsForEdit()
async loadAlbumsForEdit(seriesId) {
    // Get series queries
    const series = albumSeriesStore.getSeries().find(s => s.id === seriesId)
    const queries = series.albumQueries
    
    // Load albums
    const { results } = await apiClient.fetchMultipleAlbums(queries)
    
    // Filter: Only add albums that matched their queries
    const validAlbums = results.filter(r => {
        if (r.status !== 'success') return false
        const expected = this.extractAlbumName(r.query)
        const actual = r.album.title
        return calculateSimilarity(expected, actual) >= 0.4
    })
    
    // Set in store with explicit seriesId
    albumsStore.setAlbumsForSeries(seriesId, validAlbums.map(r => r.album))
}
```

---

## Implementation Priority

| Phase | Change | Files | Effort |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Add similarity validation to `fetchAlbum()` | `client.js` | S |
| 2 | Add AlbumIdentity model | `models/AlbumIdentity.js` (new) | M |
| 3 | Refactor cache key strategy | `albumCache.js` | M |
| 4 | Series-scoped album loading | `PlaylistsController.js` | M |
| 5 | Migrate existing cached data | Migration script | S |

---

## Testing Plan

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - `AlbumIdentity.calculateConfidence()` with edge cases
   - `albumCache` with new key strategy

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Load series with problematic albums (Page & Plant)
   - Verify no cross-series pollution

3. **Manual Verification**:
   - "Robert Plant 00-10s" series should have exactly 7 albums
   - Reconfigure panel should apply settings

# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\sprint13-tech-debt\arch-1-playlistsview_spec.md
--------------------------------------------------
# Specification: ARCH-1 Decompose PlaylistsView (God Class) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## 1. Problem Description
`PlaylistsView.js` has grown to over 960 lines of code. It violates the Single Responsibility Principle by handling:
- UI Rendering (`PlaylistsGridRenderer`)
- State Management (interacting with Stores)
- Drag and Drop Logic (`PlaylistsDragHandler`)
- Event Handling
- Modal Logic

This makes the file difficult to read, test, and maintain.

## 2. Goal
Refactor `PlaylistsView.js` into smaller, focused modules (Components/Controllers) to reduce its size to < 300 LOC and improve maintainability.

## 3. Scope
- **Target**: `public/js/views/PlaylistsView.js`
- **Output**:
    - `PlaylistsView.js` (Orchestrator only)
    - `public/js/components/playlists/PlaylistsDragHandler.js` (Logic extraction)
    - `public/js/components/playlists/PlaylistsGridRenderer.js` (DOM rendering)
    - `public/js/controllers/PlaylistsController.js` (Mediator - if aligning with V3 architecture)

## 4. Success Criteria
1.  **Code Size**: `PlaylistsView.js` is under 400 lines (soft limit).
2.  **Modularity**: Logic for Drag-and-Drop is isolated and reusable/testable.
3.  **No Regression**: All playlist functionalities (Create, Edit, Delete, DnD, Reorder) work exactly as before.

## 5. Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with `PlaylistsStore`.
- Must use existing CSS classes (no visual changes).

## 6. User Review Required
- **Architecture**: Do you agree with introducing `PlaylistsController` now (DEBT-3) as part of this refactor, or should we keep it View-centric for now? (Recommendation: Do Controller now to solve DEBT-3 simultaneously).

## Goal

Refactor `SpotifyEnrichmentStore` to use `BaseRepository` pattern, eliminating custom Firestore code and ensuring architectural consistency.

---

## Current State Analysis

### SpotifyEnrichmentStore.js (241 LOC)

| Method | Does What | BaseRepository Equivalent |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------|
| `get(artist, album)` | Fetch by normalized key + TTL validation | `findById()` + custom validation |
| `save(artist, album, data)` | setDoc with schema version | `save()` ✅ Compatible |
| `delete(artist, album)` | deleteDoc | `delete()` ✅ Compatible |
| `hasValidEnrichment()` | Calls get() and checks null | Keep as helper |
| `getCount()` | getDocs + snapshot.size | `count()` ✅ Compatible |
| `normalizeKey()` | Generate deterministic key | **KEEP** (domain-specific) |
| `isValid()` | TTL + schema check | **KEEP** (domain-specific) |

### BaseRepository.js (337 LOC)

**Key Features:**
- Cache integration (L1/L2)
- Standardized CRUD (create, findById, save, update, delete)
- Schema versioning
- Batch operations

**Gap Identified:**
- BaseRepository expects `this.collectionPath` as static user-scoped path
- SpotifyEnrichment uses **global** collection (`spotify_enrichment`)

---

## Architecture Decision

### Option A: Extend BaseRepository with Global Collection Support ✅ RECOMMENDED

```javascript
// SpotifyEnrichmentRepository.js
export class SpotifyEnrichmentRepository extends BaseRepository {
    constructor(firestore, cache) {
        super(firestore, cache)
        this.collectionPath = 'spotify_enrichment' // Global, no userId
    }
    
    // Override key generation for normalized artist-album key
    normalizeKey(artist, album) {
        return `${artist}-${album}`
            .toLowerCase()
            .normalize('NFD')
            .replace(/[\u0300-\u036f]/g, '')
            .replace(/[^a-z0-9-]/g, '-')
            .replace(/-+/g, '-')
            .replace(/^-|-$/g, '')
            .substring(0, 100)
    }
}
```

### Option B: Modify BaseRepository for scoped/global mode

```javascript
// Would require changes to BaseRepository constructor
constructor(firestore, cache, options = { scoped: true })
```

**Decision**: Option A is cleaner - no changes to BaseRepository needed.

## Refactoring Plan

### Step 1: Create SpotifyEnrichmentRepository.js

```javascript
// public/js/repositories/SpotifyEnrichmentRepository.js

import { BaseRepository } from './BaseRepository.js'

const MAX_AGE_MS = 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 30 days
const CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1

export class SpotifyEnrichmentRepository extends BaseRepository {
    constructor(firestore, cache) {
        super(firestore, cache)
        this.collectionPath = 'spotify_enrichment' // Global collection
        this.schemaVersion = CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION
    }
    
    /**
     * Generate normalized key (domain-specific)
     */
    normalizeKey(artist, album) {
        return `${artist}-${album}`
            .toLowerCase()
            .normalize('NFD')
            .replace(/[\u0300-\u036f]/g, '')
            .replace(/[^a-z0-9-]/g, '-')
            .replace(/-+/g, '-')
            .replace(/^-|-$/g, '')
            .substring(0, 100)
    }
    
    /**
     * Validate enrichment data (domain-specific)
     */
    isValid(data) {
        if (!data) return false
        if (data.enrichedAt && Date.now() - data.enrichedAt > MAX_AGE_MS) return false
        if (data.schemaVersion !== CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION) return false
        if (!data.spotifyId) return false
        return true
    }
    
    /**
     * Get by artist-album (convenience method)
     */
    async getByArtistAlbum(artist, album) {
        const key = this.normalizeKey(artist, album)
        return this.findById(key)
    }
    
    /**
     * Save by artist-album (convenience method)
     */
    async saveEnrichment(artist, album, enrichmentData) {
        const key = this.normalizeKey(artist, album)
        return this.save(key, {
            ...enrichmentData,
            artist,
            album,
            enrichedAt: Date.now()
        })
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Refactor SpotifyEnrichmentStore.js

```javascript
// public/js/stores/SpotifyEnrichmentStore.js (AFTER)

import { db } from '../firebase-init.js'
import { SpotifyEnrichmentRepository } from '../repositories/SpotifyEnrichmentRepository.js'
import { CacheManager } from '../cache/CacheManager.js'

class SpotifyEnrichmentStore {
    constructor() {
        this.repository = new SpotifyEnrichmentRepository(db, new CacheManager())
    }
    
    async get(artist, album, albumExistsCheck = null) {
        const data = await this.repository.getByArtistAlbum(artist, album)
        
        // Validation
        if (!data || !this.repository.isValid(data)) {
            return null
        }
        
        // Orphan cleanup (lazy)
        if (albumExistsCheck && typeof albumExistsCheck === 'function') {
            const exists = await albumExistsCheck(artist, album)
            if (!exists) {
                await this.delete(artist, album)
                return null
            }
        }
        
        return data
    }
    
    async save(artist, album, enrichmentData) {
        return this.repository.saveEnrichment(artist, album, enrichmentData)
    }
    
    async delete(artist, album) {
        const key = this.repository.normalizeKey(artist, album)
        return this.repository.delete(key)
    }
    
    async hasValidEnrichment(artist, album) {
        const data = await this.get(artist, album)
        return data !== null
    }
    
    async getCount() {
        return this.repository.count()
    }
}

export const spotifyEnrichmentStore = new SpotifyEnrichmentStore()
```

## Files to Change

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `repositories/SpotifyEnrichmentRepository.js` | **NEW** | Repository extending BaseRepository |
| `stores/SpotifyEnrichmentStore.js` | **REFACTOR** | Delegate to repository |

### Lines of Code Impact

| Component | Before | After | Δ |
|-----------|--------|-------|---|
| SpotifyEnrichmentStore.js | 241 | ~80 | -161 |
| SpotifyEnrichmentRepository.js | 0 | ~70 | +70 |
| **Net Change** | - | - | **-91 LOC** |

---

## Verification Plan

### 1. Unit Tests

```bash
# Run existing tests (should pass)
npm test -- --grep "SpotifyEnrichment"
```

### 2. Manual Verification

1. **Open app** at `http://mjrp.local:5000`
2. **Navigate to Albums** view with Spotify-enriched series
3. **Verify enrichment data** loads correctly (check console for `[EnrichmentStore]` logs)
4. **Add new album** → Verify enrichment saves
5. **Check Firestore** console → `spotify_enrichment` collection should have entries

### 3. Regression Check

- [ ] Enrichment loads on page refresh
- [ ] Enrichment shows in Blending Menu
- [ ] Enrichment persists after logout/login
- [ ] No console errors

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Cache invalidation timing differs | Medium | Test thoroughly, compare behavior |
| Global collection path issue | Low | Already works, just formalizing |
| Breaking change to enrichment format | High | Keep schema version check |

---

## Status: Awaiting User Review

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please confirm:
> 1. Option A (extend BaseRepository) vs Option B (modify BaseRepository)?
> 2. Should we add more convenience methods to Repository?
> 3. Proceed with implementation?



# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\sprint13-tech-debt\arch-2-standardize-stores_spec.md
--------------------------------------------------
# Specification: ARCH-2 Standardize Stores

## 1. Problem Description
`SpotifyEnrichmentStore.js` implements its own caching and Firestore logic, deviating from the established `BaseRepository` pattern used by `AlbumSeriesStore` and others.
This inconsistency makes the codebase harder to learn and introduces bugs (like the custom `spotify_enrichment` path issue we just fixed).

## 2. Goal
Refactor `SpotifyEnrichmentStore` to use a dedicated `SpotifyEnrichmentRepository` that extends `BaseRepository`.

## 3. Scope
- **New Repository**: `public/js/repositories/SpotifyEnrichmentRepository.js`
- **Refactor**: `public/js/stores/SpotifyEnrichmentStore.js`
- **Inheritance**: Ensure `BaseRepository` features (cache invalidation, standardized CRUD) are leveraged.

## 4. Success Criteria
1.  **Pattern Compliance**: Store delegates data access to Repository.
2.  **Code Deletion**: Custom Firestore fetching code removed from Store.
3.  **Functionality**: Enrichment continues to work with no regression.

## 5. User Review Required
- **Global vs Scoped**: `BaseRepository` usually handles user scoping. `SpotifyEnrichment` is Global.
    - *Decision*: We may need to tweak `BaseRepository` to support `global` (user-agnostic) collections elegantly, or override the path generation in the new Repository.

# Plan: ARCH-3 BaseCard Component

**Created**: 2025-12-26  
**Status**: ✅ DONE  
**Spec**: [arch-3-basecard_spec.md](./arch-3-basecard_spec.md)

---

## Goal

Create a `BaseCard` component that encapsulates shared card structure and styling. Refactor existing cards to use composition.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Card Components Analyzed

| Component | LOC | Pattern | Common Elements |
|-----------|-----|---------|-----------------|
| BlendFlavorCard | 173 | Instance methods | `rounded-xl border`, hover effects, `getIcon()` |
| BatchGroupCard | 174 | Static methods | `rounded-xl border-white/10`, `escapeHtml()`, `getIcon()` |
| PlaylistCard | 120 | Static methods | `rounded-xl border-white/10`, `escapeHtml()`, `getIcon()` |
| EntityCard | 77 | Delegates | Different pattern (uses AlbumsGridRenderer) |

### Common Patterns Identified

1. **Container Styling**: `rounded-xl border border-white/10 bg-surface`
2. **Hover Effects**: `hover:border-brand-orange/30`, `transition-all duration-300`
3. **Icon Rendering**: All use `getIcon()` from `Icons.js`
4. **HTML Escaping**: `escapeHtml()` duplicated in BatchGroupCard and PlaylistCard
5. **Header/Body Structure**: Header with title + body with content

---

## Architecture Decision

**Pattern: Composition with Static Helper Functions** ✅ RECOMMENDED

Since all cards use String Templates (`static render()`), we'll provide composition helpers instead of inheritance.

```javascript
// BaseCard.js - Composition approach
export class BaseCard {
    static renderContainer({ header, body, footer, className = '' }) {
        return `
            <div class="base-card rounded-xl border border-white/10 bg-surface 
                        overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 
                        hover:border-brand-orange/30 ${className}">
                ${header ? `<div class="card-header">${header}</div>` : ''}
                ${body ? `<div class="card-body">${body}</div>` : ''}
                ${footer ? `<div class="card-footer">${footer}</div>` : ''}
            </div>
        `
    }
    
    static escapeHtml(text) {
        if (!text) return ''
        const div = document.createElement('div')
        div.textContent = text
        return div.innerHTML
    }
}
```

### Why Not Inheritance?

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Inheritance | Classic OOP | Doesn't work with static render() |
| Composition | Works with static, flexible | Slightly more verbose |
| Mixins | Reusable logic chunks | Complex, not needed here |

---

## Proposed BaseCard Component

### File: `components/base/BaseCard.js`

```javascript
/**
 * BaseCard Component
 * 
 * Base card component providing consistent styling and structure.
 * Uses composition pattern for String Template rendering.
 * 
 * @module components/base/BaseCard
 * @since ARCH-3
 */

import { getIcon } from '../Icons.js'

export class BaseCard {
    /**
     * Default card CSS classes (can be overridden)
     */
    static BASE_CLASSES = 'rounded-xl border border-white/10 bg-surface overflow-hidden'
    static HOVER_CLASSES = 'transition-all duration-300 hover:border-brand-orange/30'
    
    /**
     * Render card container with header, body, and footer slots
     * @param {Object} options
     * @param {string} [options.header] - Header HTML content
     * @param {string} [options.body] - Body HTML content  
     * @param {string} [options.footer] - Footer HTML content
     * @param {string} [options.className] - Additional CSS classes
     * @param {Object} [options.dataAttrs] - Data attributes { key: value }
     * @returns {string} HTML string
     */
    static renderContainer(options = {}) {
        const { header, body, footer, className = '', dataAttrs = {} } = options
        
        const dataAttrsStr = Object.entries(dataAttrs)
            .map(([k, v]) => `data-${k}="${this.escapeHtml(v)}"`)
            .join(' ')
        
        return `
            <div class="${this.BASE_CLASSES} ${this.HOVER_CLASSES} ${className}"
                 ${dataAttrsStr}>
                ${header ? `<div class="card-header p-4 bg-white/5 border-b border-white/10">${header}</div>` : ''}
                ${body ? `<div class="card-body">${body}</div>` : ''}
                ${footer ? `<div class="card-footer p-4 border-t border-white/10">${footer}</div>` : ''}
            </div>
        `
    }
    
    /**
     * Escape HTML special characters
     * @param {string} text - Text to escape
     * @returns {string} Escaped HTML
     */
    static escapeHtml(text) {
        if (!text) return ''
        const div = document.createElement('div')
        div.textContent = text
        return div.innerHTML
    }
    
    /**
     * Render icon using Icons.js
     * @param {string} iconName - Lucide icon name
     * @param {string} [className] - Additional CSS classes
     * @returns {string} Icon HTML
     */
    static icon(iconName, className = 'w-4 h-4') {
        return getIcon(iconName, className)
    }
}
```

---

## Refactoring Strategy

### PlaylistCard (Target 1 - Simplest)

**Before:**
```javascript
return `
  <div class="playlist-card bg-surface rounded-xl border border-white/10 overflow-hidden" ...>
    <div class="playlist-header p-4 bg-white/5 border-b border-white/10 ...">
      ...header content...
    </div>
    <div class="playlist-tracks ...">
      ...body content...
    </div>
  </div>
`
```

**After:**
```javascript
import { BaseCard } from '../base/BaseCard.js'

return BaseCard.renderContainer({
    header: `...header content...`,
    body: `...body content...`,
    className: 'playlist-card',
    dataAttrs: { 'playlist-index': index }
})
```

### BatchGroupCard (Target 2)

Similar refactoring, removing duplicated `escapeHtml()`.

---

## BatchGroupCard Enhancements (NEW)

In addition to BaseCard integration, we'll add UX improvements:

### Feature 1: Collapsible Header (Default: Collapsed)

<div class="batch-group-card" data-collapsed="true">
    <div class="batch-header cursor-pointer" data-action="toggle-collapse">
        <span class="collapse-icon">▶</span> <!-- or ▼ when expanded -->
        ...
    </div>
    <div class="batch-playlists hidden"> <!-- toggled by JS -->
        ...
    </div>
</div>

// Toggle handler in SavedPlaylistsView
container.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    if (e.target.closest('[data-action="toggle-collapse"]')) {
        const card = e.target.closest('.batch-group-card')
        const isCollapsed = card.dataset.collapsed === 'true'
        card.dataset.collapsed = !isCollapsed
        card.querySelector('.batch-playlists').classList.toggle('hidden')
        card.querySelector('.collapse-icon').textContent = isCollapsed ? '▼' : '▶'
    }
})
```

## Files to Change

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `components/base/BaseCard.js` | **NEW** | Base component with helpers |
| `components/base/index.js` | **NEW** | Barrel export |
| `components/playlists/PlaylistCard.js` | **REFACTOR** | Use BaseCard.renderContainer |
| `components/playlists/BatchGroupCard.js` | **REFACTOR** | Use BaseCard.renderContainer, remove escapeHtml |

### LOC Impact (Estimated)

| Component | Before | After | Δ |
|-----------|--------|-------|---|
| BaseCard.js | 0 | ~60 | +60 |
| PlaylistCard.js | 120 | ~90 | -30 |
| BatchGroupCard.js | 174 | ~140 | -34 |
| **Net Change** | - | - | **~-4 LOC** |

> [!NOTE]
> Net LOC reduction is small, but code reuse and consistency improve significantly.

---

## Verification Plan

### 1. Visual Verification

- Open PlaylistsView
- Verify cards render correctly
- Check hover effects work
- Confirm no style regressions

### 2. Functional Verification

- Edit playlist name (PlaylistCard editable mode)
- Delete batch (BatchGroupCard actions)
- All button actions work

---

## Excluded from Scope

| Component | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| BlendFlavorCard | Uses instance methods, different lifecycle |
| EntityCard | Delegates to AlbumsGridRenderer, already has wrapper |

These can be refactored in a future iteration if needed.

---

## Status: Awaiting User Review

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please confirm:
> 1. Composition pattern OK (vs inheritance)?
> 2. Start with PlaylistCard + BatchGroupCard only?
> 3. Proceed with implementation?



# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\sprint13-tech-debt\arch-3-basecard_spec.md
--------------------------------------------------
# Specification: ARCH-3 Implement BaseCard Component

## 1. Problem Description
The application uses multiple "Card" components (`PlaylistCard`, `BatchGroupCard`, `BlendFlavorCard`) which duplicate common logic:
- Basic container styling (Glassmorphism, borders).
- Hover effects.
- Icon rendering.
- Basic interactions.

This leads to visual inconsistencies and code duplication (Low Reuse: 5%).

## 2. Goal
Create a `BaseCard` component that encapsulates the shared structure and styling of all cards in the application. Refactor existing cards to extend or compose `BaseCard`.

## 3. Scope
- **New Component**: `public/js/components/base/BaseCard.js`
- **Refactor Targets**:
    - `BatchGroupCard.js`
    - `BlendFlavorCard.js`
    - `PlaylistCard.js` (if exists or its equivalent)

## 4. Success Criteria
1.  **Reuse**: `BaseCard` is used by at least 2 distinct card implementations.
2.  **Consistency**: All cards share the exact same base padding, border-radius, and hover behaviors.
3.  **Code Reduction**: Reduced boilerplate in individual card files.

## 5. Constraints
- Must support `HTMLElement` or String-based rendering (depending on current architecture).
    - *Note*: Current App seems to use String-Template rendering (`static render()`). `BaseCard` should likely provide a static `renderContainer(innerHtml, options)` helper.

## 6. User Review Required
- **Design Pattern**: Composition vs Inheritance. Recommendation: Composition (Helper function) since we use String Templates. `BaseCard.render({ header, body, footer, classes })`.

**Date**: 2025-12-26  
**Spec**: [arch-5-cache-consolidation_spec.md](./arch-5-cache-consolidation_spec.md)

## 1. Architecture Overview

### Current vs Target State

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "CURRENT (Fragmented)"
        API1[apiClient] --> AC1[AlbumCache]
        AC1 --> MEM1[(Memory Map)]
        AC1 --> LS[(localStorage)]
        
        CM1[CacheManager] -.-> MEM2[(MemoryCache)]
        CM1 -.-> IDB1[(IndexedDB)]
    end
```

```mermaid

        AC2 --> CM2[CacheManager]
        CM2 --> MEM3[(Memory L1)]
        CM2 --> IDB2[(IndexedDB L2)]
    end
```

---

## 2. Component Strategy

### Files to Modify

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `cache/albumCache.js` | **REFACTOR** | Use CacheManager as backend instead of localStorage |
| `cache/CacheManager.js` | **MINOR** | Add key normalization helper |
| `cache/MemoryCache.js` | **DELETE** | Replace with native Map in CacheManager |
| `api/client.js` | **NONE** | Already uses albumCache.get/set API |

### New Code Structure

```javascript
// albumCache.js (refactored)
import { cacheManager } from './CacheManager.js'

class AlbumCache {
    constructor() {
        this.ttl = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 7 days
        this.version = '4.0' // Bump for IndexedDB migration
        this.migrationDone = false
    }
    
    normalizeKey(query) {
        return `album:${query.toLowerCase().trim().replace(/\s+/g, ' ')}`
    }
    
    async get(query) {
        const key = this.normalizeKey(query)
        
        // Try new cache first
        let data = await cacheManager.get(key)
        
        // Fallback to localStorage (migration period)
        if (!data && !this.migrationDone) {
            data = this.legacyGet(query)
            if (data) {
                // Migrate to new cache
                await cacheManager.set(key, data, this.ttl)
            }
        }
        
        return data
    }
    
    async set(query, album) {
        const key = this.normalizeKey(query)
        await cacheManager.set(key, album, this.ttl)
    }
    
    // Legacy localStorage access (for migration only)
    legacyGet(query) { ... }
}
```

---

## 3. Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Dual-Read (Day 1-7)
```
READ:  new IndexedDB → if miss → old localStorage
WRITE: new IndexedDB only
```

### Phase 2: Cleanup (Day 8+)
```
READ:  new IndexedDB only
WRITE: new IndexedDB only
DELETE: localStorage entries with 'album_cache_' prefix
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App
    participant AC as AlbumCache
    participant CM as CacheManager
    participant IDB as IndexedDB
    participant LS as localStorage

    Note over App,LS: Phase 1: Migration Period
    
    App->>AC: get("Pink Floyd - The Wall")
    AC->>CM: get("album:pink floyd - the wall")
    CM->>IDB: get(key)
    
    alt IndexedDB Hit
        IDB-->>CM: album data
        CM-->>AC: album data
    else IndexedDB Miss
        IDB-->>CM: null
        CM-->>AC: null
        AC->>LS: getItem(legacyKey)
        LS-->>AC: old data
        AC->>CM: set(key, data) [migrate]
    end
    
    AC-->>App: album data
```

---

## 4. Key Normalization

### Before (Problem)
```javascript
// Different queries = different cache entries
"Pink Floyd - The Wall"   → cache key: "album_cache_v3.1_Pink Floyd - The Wall"
"pink floyd - the wall"   → cache key: "album_cache_v3.1_pink floyd - the wall"
"Pink Floyd-The Wall"     → cache key: "album_cache_v3.1_Pink Floyd-The Wall"
```

### After (Normalized)
```javascript
// All normalize to same key
"Pink Floyd - The Wall"   → "album:pink floyd - the wall"
"pink floyd - the wall"   → "album:pink floyd - the wall"  
"Pink Floyd-The Wall"     → "album:pink floyd - the wall"
```

---

## 5. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare CacheManager (30 min)
- [ ] Add `normalizeKey()` method if needed
- [ ] Verify IndexedDB init works in all browsers
- [ ] Add migration cleanup method

### Step 2: Refactor AlbumCache (1h)
- [ ] Convert class to async (all methods return Promise)
- [ ] Replace localStorage with cacheManager calls  
- [ ] Add `normalizeKey()` function
- [ ] Implement `legacyGet()` for migration

### Step 3: Update Consumers (30 min)
- [ ] Update `apiClient` to await cache methods
- [ ] Test API flow end-to-end

### Step 4: Cleanup (30 min)
- [ ] Delete `MemoryCache.js`
- [ ] Remove unused localStorage legacy code after 7 days
- [ ] Update CACHE_ARCHITECTURE.md

---

## 6. Testing Plan

| Test | Expected Result |
|------|-----------------|
| Fresh load (no cache) | Album fetched from API, saved to IndexedDB |
| Refresh page | Album loaded from IndexedDB L2, promoted to L1 |
| DevTools → IndexedDB | See `mjrp-cache` DB with album entries |
| DevTools → localStorage | No new `album_cache_` entries |
| Case variation query | Same cache entry returned |

---

## 7. Rollback Plan

If issues found:
1. Revert `albumCache.js` to use localStorage
2. IndexedDB data remains (not lost)
3. Users continue with localStorage cache

# ARCH-5: Cache Consolidation Specification
**Status**: 📋 DRAFT - Awaiting Review  
**Date**: 2025-12-26  
**Author**: AI Agent  
**Sprint**: 14

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current State
The application has **two parallel cache systems** that are not integrated:

| System | L1 | L2 | Status |
|--------|----|----|--------|
| **AlbumCache** | Memory Map | localStorage (5MB limit) | ✅ Active |
| **CacheManager** | MemoryCache | IndexedDB (500MB+) | ❌ Dead code |

### Problems
1. **Dead Code**: CacheManager/IndexedDB exists but is never used
2. **Storage Limit**: localStorage caps at ~5MB (~500-1000 albums max)
3. **Inconsistent Keys**: Query strings are case-sensitive, causing cache misses
4. **No Unified API**: Direct localStorage usage scattered across codebase

---

## 2. Proposed Solution

**Migrate AlbumCache to use CacheManager as its storage backend.**

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Current"
        AC1[AlbumCache] --> LS[(localStorage)]
    end
    
    subgraph "Proposed"
        AC2[AlbumCache] --> CM[CacheManager]
        CM --> MEM[(Memory L1)]
        CM --> IDB[(IndexedDB L2)]
    end
```

### Key Changes
1. AlbumCache becomes a **facade** over CacheManager
2. Replace localStorage L2 with IndexedDB L2
3. Normalize cache keys (lowercase, trimmed)
4. Add migration path for existing localStorage data

---

## 3. Success Criteria

| # | Criteria | Validation |
|---|----------|------------|
| 1 | Albums cached in IndexedDB, not localStorage | DevTools → Application → IndexedDB |
| 2 | Existing cached albums migrated automatically | No re-fetch on first load after deploy |
| 3 | Cache key normalized (case-insensitive) | `"Pink Floyd - The Wall"` = `"pink floyd - the wall"` |
| 4 | No regression in album loading flow | Manual test: Load series, refresh, verify cache hits |
| 5 | Dead code removed or repurposed | MemoryCache.js removed if redundant |

---

## 4. Out of Scope

- Auth token storage migration (future task)
- User preferences storage (viewMode, currency)
- Spotify enrichment cache
- Server-side caching

---

## 5. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Regression in album loading | 🔴 HIGH | Feature flag + fallback to localStorage |
| Data loss on migration | 🟠 MED | Read from both, write to new only |
| IndexedDB unavailable (Safari private) | 🟡 LOW | CacheManager already has fallback logic |

---

## 6. Dependencies

- `public/js/cache/CacheManager.js` (exists, needs integration)
- `public/js/cache/IndexedDBCache.js` (exists, used by CacheManager)
- `public/js/cache/albumCache.js` (refactor target)
- `public/js/api/client.js` (consumer, minimal changes)

---

## 7. Decisions (Approved 2025-12-26)

| Question | Decision |
|----------|----------|
| Migration fallback window | **7 days** (matches TTL) |
| Feature flag toggle | **No** (read-from-both is sufficient) |
| Cleanup MemoryCache.js | **Yes**, if replaceable by native Map |

## 2. Changes by File

### File 1: SeriesController.js

#### Change A: Incremental Render in Callback

```diff
// In loadAlbumsFromQueries callback
(current, total, result) => {
    if (this.abortController.signal.aborted) return;

    this.state.loadProgress = { current, total };
    const progressLabel = result.album
        ? `Loading: ${result.album.artist} - ${result.album.title}`
        : `Processing... (${Math.round((current / total) * 100)}%)`;

    this.notifyView('progress', { current, total, label: progressLabel });

    if (result.status === 'success' && result.album) {
        this.hydrateAndAddAlbum(result.album);
+       // ARCH-6: Incremental render - sync with progress bar
+       this.notifyView('albums', albumsStore.getAlbums());
    }
}
```

#### Change B: Store Cache Check in loadScope

```diff
async loadScope(scopeType, seriesId = null, skipCache = false) {
    this.state.currentScope = scopeType;
    this.state.targetSeriesId = seriesId;

    const storeContextId = scopeType === 'ALL' ? 'ALL_SERIES_VIEW' : seriesId;

+   // ARCH-6: Check store cache BEFORE loading
+   if (!skipCache && albumsStore.hasAlbumsForSeries(storeContextId)) {
+       console.log('[SeriesController] ✅ Cache HIT - instant render');
+       albumsStore.setActiveAlbumSeriesId(storeContextId);
+       albumSeriesStore.setActiveSeries(scopeType === 'ALL' ? null : seriesId);
+       this.notifyView('header', this.getHeaderData());
+       this.notifyView('albums', albumsStore.getAlbumsForSeries(storeContextId));
+       this.notifyView('loading', false);
+       return;
+   }

    // Cache MISS - proceed with loading
    this.state.isLoading = true;
    this.notifyView('loading', true);
    // ... rest
```

#### Change C: Remove reset(true) in loadAlbumsFromQueries

```diff
async loadAlbumsFromQueries(queries, skipCache = false) {
    // Cancel previous
    if (this.abortController) {
        this.abortController.abort();
    }
    this.abortController = new AbortController();

-   albumsStore.reset(true);
-   this.notifyView('albums', []);
+   // ARCH-6: Don't reset - just clear current series
+   albumsStore.clearAlbumSeries(albumsStore.getActiveAlbumSeriesId());

    this.state.isLoading = true;
    // ... rest
```

---

### File 2: SeriesView.js

#### Change A: handleSeriesChange - Direct loadScope

```diff
handleSeriesChange(value) {
-   if (value === 'all') {
-       router.navigate('/albums');
-   } else {
-       router.navigate(`/albums?seriesId=${value}`);
-   }
+   const seriesId = value === 'all' ? null : value;
+   const scopeType = seriesId ? 'SINGLE' : 'ALL';
+   
+   // ARCH-6: Direct call, no router remount
+   if (this.controller) {
+       this.controller.loadScope(scopeType, seriesId);
+   }
+   
+   // Update URL without navigation
+   const url = seriesId ? `/albums?seriesId=${seriesId}` : '/albums';
+   window.history.replaceState({}, '', url);
+   
+   // Update internal state
+   this.currentScope = scopeType;
+   this.targetSeriesId = seriesId;
}
```

---

### File 3: albums.js (store)

#### Change: reset() Preserves Map

```diff
reset(preserveAlbumSeriesContext = false) {
    const seriesId = preserveAlbumSeriesContext ? this.activeAlbumSeriesId : null;

-   // ALWAYS clear all albums
-   this.albumsByAlbumSeriesId.clear();
+   // ARCH-6: Only clear if full reset
+   if (!preserveAlbumSeriesContext) {
+       this.albumsByAlbumSeriesId.clear();
+   }

    this.currentAlbum = null;
    this.loading = false;
    this.error = null;
    this.activeAlbumSeriesId = seriesId;
    this.notify();
}
```

---

### File 4: SeriesView.js (CRUD handlers)

#### Change: Cache Invalidation

```diff
// In mountSeriesModals()
this.components.modals = new SeriesModals({
    onSeriesUpdated: (seriesId) => {
+       // ARCH-6: Invalidate cache
+       albumsStore.clearAlbumSeries(seriesId);
+       albumsStore.clearAlbumSeries('ALL_SERIES_VIEW');
        this.updateHeader();
        if (this.controller) {
            this.controller.loadScope(this.currentScope, this.targetSeriesId, true);
        }
    },
    onSeriesDeleted: (seriesId) => {
+       // ARCH-6: Invalidate cache
+       albumsStore.clearAlbumSeries(seriesId);
+       albumsStore.clearAlbumSeries('ALL_SERIES_VIEW');
        if (this.targetSeriesId === seriesId) {
            router.navigate('/albums');
        } else {
            this.refreshGrid();
        }
    },
```

---

## 3. Implementation Order

| Step | Change | Time |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Incremental render (callback) | 5 min |
| 2 | Store cache check (loadScope) | 10 min |
| 3 | Remove reset() in loadAlbumsFromQueries | 5 min |
| 4 | handleSeriesChange (no router) | 5 min |
| 5 | reset() preserves Map | 5 min |
| 6 | CRUD cache invalidation | 5 min |
| 7 | Test all 3 scenarios | 15 min |

**Total**: ~50 min

---

## 4. Testing Plan

### Test 1: Incremental Render
1. Clear IndexedDB cache
2. Navigate to `/albums`
3. **Expected**: Albums appear 1 by 1 as progress bar advances

### Test 2: Filter Change Cache Hit
1. Load "All Series"
2. Change filter to "LED SERIES"
3. Change back to "All Series"
4. **Expected**: Instant switch, console shows "Cache HIT"

### Test 3: Navigate Away/Back
1. Load `/albums`
2. Go to `/playlists`
3. Return to `/albums`
4. **Expected**: Albums appear instantly

### Test 4: Refresh Button
1. Load a series
2. Click Refresh
3. **Expected**: Full reload (skipCache=true)

---

## 5. Rollback Plan

If critical issues:
```bash
git revert HEAD  # Reverts ARCH-6 changes
```

# ARCH-6: SeriesView Loading Optimization Specification

**Status**: 📋 REVISED - Awaiting Review  
**Date**: 2025-12-26  
**Author**: AI Agent  
**Sprint**: 14  
**Revision**: v2 (Previous attempt reverted in `29875ef`)

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### User Experience Issues

The SeriesView has multiple UX inconsistencies that degrade user experience:

| # | Issue | User Impact | Severity |
|---|-------|-------------|----------|
| **P1** | Grid shows "No albums" during loading | User thinks library is empty | 🔴 HIGH |
| **P2** | Albums appear all at once at end | No sense of loading progress | 🔴 HIGH |
| **P3** | Filter dropdown triggers full remount | Slow, causes visual flash | 🟠 MED |
| **P4** | Navigate away/back reloads all data | Wasted time, data in memory | 🟠 MED |
| **P5** | Series dropdown empty on initial load | User can't see available series | 🟡 LOW |

### Scenario 1: Fresh Load (Cold Cache)

**Current Behavior**:
```
0s    View mounts, toolbar empty
0s    loadScope() → reset() → notifyView('albums', [])
      ├── Grid shows "No albums in library" ❌
0.1s  IndexedDB cache hits, albums add to store
      ├── onAlbumsChange() SKIPPED (isLoading=true) ❌
2s    67 albums loaded to store (not visible) ❌
2.5s  loadScope finishes → boom, all 67 render
```

**Expected Behavior**:
```
0s    View mounts, shows loading skeleton
0.1s  First 5 albums arrive → render them ✅
1s    30 albums visible, progress shows 45%
2.5s  All 67 albums rendered (smooth arrival)
```

### Scenario 2: Filter Change

**Trigger**: User selects different series from dropdown

**Current Behavior**:
1. `router.navigate()` causes full view remount
2. View resets, shows empty (flash)
3. `albumsStore.reset()` clears ALL cached albums
4. Full reload from API/IndexedDB

**Expected Behavior**:
1. **No page reload** - update in place
2. If series was previously loaded → **instant render from cache**
3. If series not cached → load with progress (no flash)
4. URL updates via `replaceState`

### Scenario 3: Navigate Away and Back

**Trigger**: User goes `/albums` → `/playlists` → `/albums`

**Current Behavior**:
1. SeriesView unmounts (store preserved)
2. SeriesView remounts
3. `loadScope()` calls `reset()` → clears store
4. Full reload

**Expected Behavior**:
1. SeriesView unmounts (store preserved)
2. SeriesView remounts
3. **Detect cached data exists** → render immediately
4. No network/IndexedDB requests

### Root Causes

1. **`onAlbumsChange()` ignores updates during loading** - prevents incremental render
2. **Router navigation for filter change** - causes full remount
3. **`albumsStore.reset(true)` clears all albums** - loses cached data
4. **No store-level cache check** before fetching

---

## 2. Proposed Solution

### Change 1: Enable Incremental Rendering

**Problem**: `onAlbumsChange()` skips updates when `isLoading=true`

**Solution A (Recommended)**: Notify view from callback explicitly

```javascript
// In loadAlbumsFromQueries callback:
if (result.status === 'success' && result.album) {
    this.hydrateAndAddAlbum(result.album);
    // NEW: Explicit incremental update
    this.notifyView('albums', albumsStore.getAlbums());
}
```

**Solution B**: Remove the loading check (simpler but may flood updates)

```javascript
onAlbumsChange() {
    // Always update - view throttles if needed
    this.notifyView('albums', albumsStore.getAlbums());
}
```

### Change 2: Filter Without Router Navigation

Replace `router.navigate()` with direct `controller.loadScope()` call.

```javascript
// BEFORE (causes full remount)
handleSeriesChange(value) {
    router.navigate(`/albums?seriesId=${value}`);
}

// AFTER (in-place update)
handleSeriesChange(value) {
    const seriesId = value === 'all' ? null : value;
    this.controller.loadScope(seriesId ? 'SINGLE' : 'ALL', seriesId);
    // Update URL without triggering navigation
    window.history.replaceState({}, '', 
        seriesId ? `/albums?seriesId=${seriesId}` : '/albums'
    );
}
```

### Change 3: Store-Level Cache Check

Skip reset and fetch if albums already exist for the target series.

```javascript
// SeriesController.loadScope() - ADD cache check
async loadScope(scopeType, seriesId = null, skipCache = false) {
    const storeContextId = scopeType === 'ALL' ? 'ALL_SERIES_VIEW' : seriesId;
    
    // CACHE CHECK - skip load if data exists
    if (!skipCache && albumsStore.hasAlbumsForSeries(storeContextId)) {
        console.log('[SeriesController] ✅ Using cached albums from store');
        albumsStore.setActiveAlbumSeriesId(storeContextId);
        albumSeriesStore.setActiveSeries(scopeType === 'ALL' ? null : seriesId);
        this.notifyView('header', this.getHeaderData());
        this.notifyView('albums', albumsStore.getAlbumsForSeries(storeContextId));
        return;
    }
    
    // No cache - proceed with normal loading
    // ... rest of loadScope
}
```

### Change 4: Preserve Store on Navigation

Don't clear `albumsByAlbumSeriesId` Map on reset - only clear current context.

```javascript
// albums.js reset() - MODIFY
reset(preserveAlbumSeriesContext = false) {
    const seriesId = preserveAlbumSeriesContext ? this.activeAlbumSeriesId : null;
    
    // ONLY clear if full reset requested
    if (!preserveAlbumSeriesContext) {
        this.albumsByAlbumSeriesId.clear();
    }
    // ... rest
}
```

### Change 5: Sync Toolbar State

When using cache, sync the toolbar dropdown to match the view.

```javascript
// Add to SeriesView
updateToolbar(data) {
    const seriesFilter = document.getElementById('seriesFilter');
    if (seriesFilter && seriesFilter.value !== (data.activeSeriesId || 'all')) {
        seriesFilter.value = data.activeSeriesId || 'all';
    }
}
```

### Change 6: CRUD Cache Invalidation

Invalidate store cache when series is edited/deleted.

```javascript
// After series CRUD operations
albumsStore.clearAlbumSeries(seriesId);
albumsStore.clearAlbumSeries('ALL_SERIES_VIEW');
```

---

## 3. Success Criteria

| # | Criteria | Validation Method |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| **SC1** | Albums render incrementally during load | Visual: albums appear as progress bar fills |
| **SC2** | Filter change: No flash | Less than 100ms if cached |
| **SC3** | Navigate back: Uses store cache | No API/IndexedDB fetch logs |
| **SC4** | Toolbar in sync with view | Dropdown always matches displayed series |
| **SC5** | Refresh button forces reload | `skipCache=true` path works |
| **SC6** | CRUD invalidates cache | After edit, next load fetches fresh |

---

## 4. Out of Scope

- Persisting albumsStore to IndexedDB (future)
- Memory optimization (LRU cache)
- Pagination / virtualization
- Background sync

---

## 5. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Ghost albums (stale data) | 🔴 HIGH | Keep series context validation + CRUD invalidation |
| Toolbar/View desync | 🟠 MED | Explicit toolbar sync on every state change |
| Memory bloat | 🟡 LOW | Defer to future (limit cached series) |

---

## 6. Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `controllers/SeriesController.js` | Add cache check, incremental render |
| `views/SeriesView.js` | handleSeriesChange, updateToolbar |
| `stores/albums.js` | reset() preserve Map |

---

## 7. Decisions

| Question | Decision |
|----------|----------|
| Incremental render - 1 or batched? | **1 por vez**, synced with progress bar callback |
| Cached filter - indicator or instant? | **Instant** (Opção A) - no artificial delay |
| Include CRUD invalidation? | **Yes** - prevents stale data |
| Unified flow pattern | **Controller is single source of loading logic** |

# Cache Architecture Documentation
**Date**: 2025-12-26
**Version**: 1.0

## Executive Summary

The application uses **3 different storage mechanisms** with **no unified strategy**:

| Storage | Persistence | Size Limit | Speed | Current Usage |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------|---------------|
| Memory (Map) | Session only | ~50MB | ⚡ Fast | L1 cache |
| localStorage | Permanent | ~5MB | 🔶 Medium | Albums, Auth, Prefs |
| IndexedDB | Permanent | ~500MB+ | 🔶 Medium | Available but UNUSED |

> [!CAUTION]
> **CacheManager with IndexedDB exists but is not being used!**
> AlbumCache uses localStorage as L2 instead.

## Cache Flow Analysis

### Album Loading (Current)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant V as View
    participant API as apiClient
    participant AC as AlbumCache
    participant LS as localStorage

    V->>API: fetchAlbum(query)
    API->>AC: get(query)
    
    alt L1 Hit (Memory)
        AC-->>API: cached album
    else L1 Miss
        AC->>LS: getItem(key)
        alt L2 Hit (localStorage)
            LS-->>AC: JSON data
            AC->>AC: Promote to L1
            AC-->>API: cached album
        else L2 Miss
            AC-->>API: null
            API->>API: Fetch from Apple Music
            API->>AC: set(query, album)
            AC->>LS: setItem(key, JSON)
        end
    end
```

---

## Identified Issues

### 1. Dead Code: CacheManager
- `CacheManager.js` and `IndexedDBCache.js` exist but are **never used**
- DEBT-2 was marked "resolved" but IndexedDB isn't utilized

### 2. localStorage Quota Risk
- 5MB limit for localStorage
- Album cache could grow large (each album ~5-10KB)
- ~500-1000 albums max before quota exceeded

### 3. No Cache Invalidation Strategy
- Only TTL-based (7 days)
- No version-based invalidation for schema changes
- Manual `version` bump in AlbumCache (currently 3.1)

### 4. Query-Based Keys
- Cache key = query string ("Artist - Album")
- Case/spacing differences = cache miss
- Example: "Pink Floyd - The Wall" ≠ "pink floyd-the wall"

### 5. Auth Tokens in localStorage
- Spotify tokens stored in localStorage (XSS vulnerable)
- Should use httpOnly cookies or sessionStorage

---

## Recommended Architecture

### Phase 1: Consolidate Cache (Quick Win)
1. Remove unused CacheManager/IndexedDBCache OR
2. Migrate AlbumCache to use CacheManager as backend

### Phase 2: Unified Storage Service
```javascript
// Proposed: StorageService.js
export class StorageService {
    constructor(namespace) {
        this.namespace = namespace
        this.memory = new Map()
        this.idb = null // IndexedDB instance
    }
    
    // Unified API
    async get(key, options = {})
    async set(key, value, options = { ttl, persist })
    async invalidate(key)
    async clear(pattern)
}
```

### Phase 3: Domain-Specific Caches
```
StorageService (base)
├── AlbumStorage extends StorageService
├── AuthStorage extends StorageService  
├── PreferencesStorage extends StorageService
└── PlaylistStorage extends StorageService
```

---

## Files to Modify

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `cache/CacheManager.js` | Decide: DELETE or migrate AlbumCache |
| `cache/IndexedDBCache.js` | Decide: DELETE or use via CacheManager |
| `cache/albumCache.js` | Refactor to use StorageService |
| `services/SpotifyAuthService.js` | Move tokens to StorageService |
| Views (3 files) | Use PreferencesStorage |
| Stores (2 files) | Use domain-specific storage |

---

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Decide: Delete CacheManager OR migrate to it
2. [ ] Create `StorageService` base class
3. [ ] Migrate AlbumCache to use new base
4. [ ] Create PreferencesStorage for view modes
5. [ ] Move auth tokens to secure storage
6. [ ] Add cache invalidation API

## Data Flow Architecture

### Album Loading Pipeline (API)
```
User Input (Query)
    ↓
apiClient.fetchAlbum(query)    [Frontend: api/client.js]
    ↓
POST /api/generate              [Backend: routes/albums.js]
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. AI (Gemini) call for tracklist  │
│  2. BestEver Scraper for rankings   │
│  3. Ranking consolidation           │
│  4. Track normalization             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
Response: { album, tracks, tracksByAcclaim, rankingConsolidated }
    ↓
apiClient.normalizeAlbumData()
    ↓
Album Model Instance (with tracks + rankings)
    ↓
albumsStore.addAlbumToSeries()
```

### Playlist Generation Flow
```
User clicks "Generate"
    ↓
PlaylistsController.handleGenerate()
    ↓
PlaylistGenerationService.generate(albums, config)
    ↓
Algorithm.generate(albums, { rankingStrategy })
    ↓
TrackTransformer.toCanonical(track)
    ↓

```

### Playlist Persistence Flow
```
User clicks "Save"
    ↓
PlaylistsController.handleSave()
    ↓
PlaylistPersistenceService.save(seriesId, playlists, batchName)
    ↓
PlaylistRepository.save() → Firestore
```

## Key Services & Their Roles

| Service | Purpose | Location |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `apiClient` | Backend API calls with caching | `api/client.js` |
| `AlbumLoader` | Load album metadata from CSV/JSON | `services/AlbumLoader.js` |
| `OptimizedAlbumLoader` | Web Worker fuzzy search (30k+ albums) | `services/OptimizedAlbumLoader.js` |
| `PlaylistGenerationService` | Algorithm execution + track transform | `services/PlaylistGenerationService.js` |
| `PlaylistPersistenceService` | Firestore CRUD for playlists | `services/PlaylistPersistenceService.js` |
| `AuthService` | Firebase Auth management | `services/AuthService.js` |
| `SpotifyEnrichmentService` | Spotify popularity data | `services/SpotifyEnrichmentService.js` |

---

## Controllers vs Views

### V3 Architecture Pattern:
```
View (Orchestrator)
  ├── render()      → HTML generation
  ├── mount()       → Initialize controller, subscribe stores
  ├── update()      → Re-render on store change
  └── Events        → Delegate to Controller

Controller (Brain)
  ├── loadInitialData()
  ├── handleGenerate()
  ├── handleSave()
  ├── loadAlbumsForSeries()
  └── No DOM manipulation

Store (State)
  ├── setPlaylists()
  ├── getPlaylists()
  └── notify() → View.update()
```

---

## Critical Findings for Current Bug

### Album Loading Pattern (Correct):
1. `SeriesController.loadScope()` → `loadAlbumsFromQueries()` → `apiClient.fetchMultipleAlbums()`
2. Albums with full track data come from **Backend API** (not Firestore)
3. `AlbumRepository` stores minimal album metadata (for persistence only)
4. Full album data with tracks is transient (in `albumsStore` during session)

### Why `OptimizedAlbumLoader` is NOT for album loading:
- It's a **search/autocomplete** service
- Uses Web Worker for performance
- Returns lightweight album metadata (no tracks!)
- Used for: HomeView search bar, Series dropdown autocomplete

### Correct Implementation Pattern:
```javascript
// PlaylistsController.loadAlbumsForSeries (CORRECT)
async loadAlbumsForSeries(seriesId) {
    // 1. Get albumQueries from series
    const activeSeries = albumSeriesStore.getActiveSeries()
    
    // 2. Load via API (with track data)
    const { results } = await apiClient.fetchMultipleAlbums(
        activeSeries.albumQueries,
        (current, total, result) => {
            if (result.album) {
                albumsStore.addAlbumToSeries(seriesId, result.album)
            }
        }
    )
}
```

Thought for 3s


Você tem razão, deixe-me verificar o HomeView atual primeiro:

Analyzed
HomeView.js#L1-789
Agora entendi! Você está certo. O fluxo atual é ótimo:

Digita o artista → Mostra discography grid
Seleciona álbuns → Vai para Staging Area
Cria série
O problema real que você identificou:

javascript
// Linha 446 - Usa MusicKitService.getArtistAlbums()
const apiResults = await musicKitService.getArtistAlbums(artistName)
E no MusicKitService.getArtistAlbums() (linha 247-291):

javascript
// Linha 269 - Limite de 100 álbuns
const albumsResult = await this.music.api.music(
    `/v1/catalog/${this._getStorefront()}/artists/${artistId}/albums`,
    { limit: 100 }
)
📊 Diagnóstico do Problema
Issue	Localização	Causa
Não vem todos os álbuns	
getArtistAlbums()
API retorna 100, mas pode haver mais (paginação?)
Filtro por tipo não funciona	Não implementado	API retorna isSingle, isCompilation mas não filtramos na UI
Variantes não agrupadas	N/A	Mostra "Album", "Album (Deluxe)", "Album (Remastered)" separados
💡 Proposta COMPLEMENTAR (sem substituir o fluxo atual)

🔧 Mudanças Técnicas Necessárias
1. Aumentar /paginação na API
javascript
// MusicKitService.getArtistAlbums() - Paginação
async getArtistAlbums(artistName, options = {}) {
    // ... find artist ...
    
    let allAlbums = []
    let offset = 0
    const limit = 100
    
    while (true) {
        const result = await this.music.api.music(
            `/v1/catalog/${this._getStorefront()}/artists/${artistId}/albums`,
            { limit, offset }  // ← Paginação
        )
        const albums = result.data?.data || []
        allAlbums.push(...albums)
        
        if (albums.length < limit) break // Acabou
        offset += limit
    }
    
    return this._mapAndClassify(allAlbums)
}
2. Adicionar Filtros na UI (HomeView)
javascript
// Novo estado
this.albumFilters = {
    types: ['album'],           // album, single, compilation
    editions: ['standard'],     // standard, remaster, deluxe, live
}
// Filtrar antes de renderizar
const filtered = apiResults.filter(album => {
    const matchesType = this.albumFilters.types.includes(album.albumType.toLowerCase())
    const matchesEdition = this.checkEditionFilter(album)
    return matchesType && matchesEdition
})
3. Agrupar Variantes (Opcional)
javascript
// AlbumVariantGrouper.group()
// "Led Zeppelin IV" → [Original, Remastered, Deluxe]
// Mostra badge com contagem de versões
❓ Perguntas para você
Paginação: Você quer que carregue TODOS os álbuns do artista (pode ser lento para artistas grandes como Beatles)?
Filtros: Quer os filtros visíveis sempre ou como dropdown/expandível?
Agrupamento: Quer que agrupe variantes (com popup) ou prefere ver todas separadas e filtrar manualmente?
O que você prefere?

# Complementary Architecture Analysis
# CRIT-5: Album Data Pipeline & Future-Proof Modular Design

**Created**: 2025-12-25 23:30
**Author**: Antigravity (AI)
**Context**: Responses to user inquiries about data model, enrichment, and extensibility

---

## 1. Reflexão: Por que CRIT-5 é Necessário?

### O Que o Schema Atual Faz Bem
O modelo de dados atual (`album_data_schema.md`) define claramente:
- `Album` com `tracks` e `tracksByAcclaim`
- `Track` com metadata, ratings, positions
- Normalização via `normalizeAlbumData()`

### O Que o Schema NÃO Resolve (e CRIT-5 Precisa Resolver)

| Problema | Por que Schema Não Resolve | CRIT-5 Solução |
|----------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Cache Key ≠ Identity** | Schema define *estrutura* do álbum, não *como* ele é identificado/buscado | AlbumIdentity model com ID estável |
| **Apple Music Mismatch** | Schema assume dados já corretos; não valida origem | Similarity validation antes de cachear |
| **Cross-Series Pollution** | Schema não define escopo; Store é global | Series-scoped loading |

**Resumo**: O Schema define "como o dado é estruturado". CRIT-5 define "como o dado é obtido e validado".

## 2. Questões de Enriquecimento de Dados

### 2.1 Enriquecimento de Álbuns (Spotify Album Data)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Fonte Primária"
        AM[Apple Music / Backend API]
    end
    
    subgraph "Enriquecimento"
        SE[SpotifyEnrichmentService]
        SEStore[SpotifyEnrichmentStore]
    end
    
    subgraph "Resultado"
        Album[Album com spotifyId, spotifyPopularity]
    end
    
    AM --> Album
    SE --> SEStore --> Album
```

**Fluxo Atual (Correto)**:
1. Álbum é carregado via `/api/generate` (Backend → AI → BestEver)
2. Se Spotify conectado, `SpotifyEnrichmentService.enrichAlbumData()` busca IDs e popularidade
3. Dados são salvos em `SpotifyEnrichmentStore` → Firestore (`spotify_enrichment/{key}`)
4. No próximo load, cache é verificado primeiro

**Arquivos Envolvidos**:
- `services/SpotifyEnrichmentService.js`
- `stores/SpotifyEnrichmentStore.js`
- `helpers/SpotifyEnrichmentHelper.js`

---

### 2.2 Enriquecimento de Faixas (Track Data)

```
Faixa Origem (API)          →  Faixa Enriquecida (Store)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
title, position, duration    ✅ Preservado
rating (BestEver)            ✅ Preservado
spotifyId                    ✅ Adicionado por SpotifyEnrichmentService
spotifyPopularity            ✅ Adicionado (0-100)
spotifyPopularityRank        ✅ Calculado (posição relativa no álbum)
```

**Como Acontece**:
```javascript
// SpotifyEnrichmentService.enrichAlbumData()
album.tracks.forEach((track, idx) => {
    const spotifyTrack = matchedTracks.find(t => similarityMatch(track.title, t.name))
    if (spotifyTrack) {
        track.spotifyId = spotifyTrack.id
        track.spotifyPopularity = spotifyTrack.popularity
    }
})
```

**Persistência**:
- Dados enriquecidos são salvos no `SpotifyEnrichmentStore`
- NÃO são salvos no `albumsStore` (transiente)
- Para uso permanente, `SpotifyEnrichmentHelper.applyEnrichmentToAlbum()` reaplica

---

## 3. Arquitetura Modular para Entidades Futuras

### 3.1 Padrão Atual (Universal Series Model)

A arquitetura já foi projetada para extensibilidade via o conceito de **Universal Series Model**:

```
Entity (Album, Artist, Genre, Track)
    ↓
EntitySeries (AlbumSeries, ArtistSeries, GenreSeries)
    ↓
Blending Menu (Algorithm + Parameters)
    ↓
Playlist Output
```

### 3.2 Como Adicionar Nova Entidade (Ex: ArtistSeries)

**Camada de Dados**:
```javascript
// NEW: repositories/ArtistSeriesRepository.js
export class ArtistSeriesRepository extends BaseRepository {
    getCollectionPath(userId) {
        return `users/${userId}/artistSeries`
    }
    // Herda: create, findAll, update, delete, findById
}
```

**Camada de Store**:
```javascript
// NEW: stores/artistSeries.js  
export class ArtistSeriesStore {
    constructor() {
        this.series = []
        this.repository = new ArtistSeriesRepository()
    }
    // Padrão Observer para notificar Views
}
```

**Camada de View**:
```javascript
// NEW: views/ArtistSeriesView.js extends BaseView
// Reusa componentes existentes:
import { SeriesHeader } from '../components/series/SeriesHeader.js'
import { SeriesGrid } from '../components/series/SeriesGrid.js'  // Parametrizado para Artists
```

### 3.3 Componentes Reutilizáveis (Atual vs Ideal)

| Componente | Reuso Atual | Reuso Ideal (ARCH-3) |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| `SeriesHeader` | AlbumSeries only | **Universal**: `<EntityHeader entity={album|artist}>` |
| `EntityCard` | AlbumCard only | **Universal**: `<EntityCard type="album|artist|genre">` |
| `BlendFlavorCard` | Blending Menu | `BaseCard` → `BlendFlavorCard extends BaseCard` |
| `BatchGroupCard` | SavedPlaylists | `BaseCard` → `BatchGroupCard extends BaseCard` |

### 3.4 Diagrama de Extensibilidade

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BaseRepository {
        <<abstract>>
        +create(entity)
        +findAll()
        +update(id, data)
        +delete(id)
    }
    
    class AlbumSeriesRepository {
        +getCollectionPath()
        +addAlbumToSeries()
    }
    
    class ArtistSeriesRepository {
        +getCollectionPath()
        +addArtistToSeries()
    }
    
    class GenreSeriesRepository {
        +getCollectionPath()
    }
    
    BaseRepository <|-- AlbumSeriesRepository
    BaseRepository <|-- ArtistSeriesRepository
    BaseRepository <|-- GenreSeriesRepository
    
    note for BaseRepository "Herança garante\nconsistência de CRUD"
```

## 4. Análise de Impacto: Persistência e CRUD

### Cenário Atual (Sem mudanças)

| Operação | View | Store | Firestore | Cache |
|----------|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Add Album to Series | SeriesView | `AlbumSeriesStore.updateSeries()` | `users/{uid}/series/{id}.albumQueries[]` | - |
| Load Series Albums | SeriesView/PlaylistsView | - | Não usado | `albumCache.get(query)` |
| Remove Album | SeriesView | `AlbumSeriesStore.removeAlbumFromSeries()` | Update albumQueries | - |
| Save Enrichment | AlbumsView | SpotifyEnrichmentStore | `spotify_enrichment/{albumId}` | - |

---

### Impacto por Fase CRIT-5

#### CRIT-5a: Validation Only (Menor impacto)

| Componente | Mudança | Impacto |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `apiClient.fetchAlbum()` | Adiciona check de similaridade | Nenhum em persistência |
| Views | Nenhuma | Nenhum |
| Firestore | Nenhuma | Nenhum |
| Cache | Rejeita low-confidence matches | Alguns álbuns não serão cacheados |

**Risco**: Álbuns legítimos com nomes diferentes (ex: "Page and Plant" vs "Robert Plant & Jimmy Page") podem ser rejeitados.

---

#### CRIT-5b: Schema Upgrade (Médio impacto)

```javascript
// ANTES: Series no Firestore
{
  albumQueries: ["Artist - Album", ...]
}

// DEPOIS: Series no Firestore
{
  albumQueries: ["Artist - Album", ...],  // Mantido para compatibilidade
  resolvedAlbums: [
    { query: "...", albumId: "...", appleId: "...", verified: true }
  ]
}
```

| Componente | Mudança | Impacto |
|------------|---------|---------|
| AlbumSeriesStore | Adicionar `resolvedAlbums` ao schema | CRUD atualizado |
| SeriesView - Add Album | Resolver e salvar junto | Novo fluxo |
| SeriesView - Load | Usar resolvedAlbums se disponível | Lógica condicional |
| SeriesView - Remove | Remover de ambos arrays | Atualizar |
| PlaylistsView - Edit | Carregar por albumId | Mais confiável |
| Firestore | Novo campo | Migration needed |

---

#### CRUD Operations Detalhadas

**CREATE (Add Album to Series)**:
```
ANTES:
  User adds "Walking Into Clarksdale"
  → Store: push query to albumQueries
  → Firestore: updateDoc({ albumQueries: [...] })
  → Done

DEPOIS:
  User adds "Walking Into Clarksdale"
  → Fetch album from Apple Music
  → If resolved:
      → Store: push to albumQueries AND resolvedAlbums
      → Firestore: updateDoc({ albumQueries, resolvedAlbums })
  → If NOT resolved:
      → Show warning "Album not found in Apple Music"
      → User decides: add anyway as query-only OR cancel
```

**READ (Load Series)**:
```
ANTES:
  SeriesController.loadAlbums()
  → Get albumQueries from series
  → apiClient.fetchMultipleAlbums(queries)
  → Results may be wrong albums!

DEPOIS:
  SeriesController.loadAlbums()
  → IF series.resolvedAlbums exists:
      → Load by albumId (não query)
      → Garantido ser o álbum certo
  → ELSE (legacy series):
      → Fallback to query-based loading
      → Run resolution on first load
```

**DELETE (Remove Album from Series)**:
```
ANTES:
  AlbumSeriesStore.removeAlbumFromSeries(album)
  → Find matching query in albumQueries
  → Remove from array
  → BUG: Se album.title ≠ query original, não encontra!

DEPOIS:
  AlbumSeriesStore.removeAlbumFromSeries(album)
  → Find by albumId in resolvedAlbums
  → Remove from resolvedAlbums AND corresponding albumQueries
  → Sempre funciona porque usa ID estável
```

---

#### CRIT-5c: Migration (One-time, High effort)

```javascript
// Migration Script
async function migrateSeriesSchema() {
  const allSeries = await albumSeriesStore.loadFromFirestore()
  
  for (const series of allSeries) {
    if (series.resolvedAlbums) continue // Already migrated
    
    const resolvedAlbums = []
    for (const query of series.albumQueries) {
      const album = await apiClient.fetchAlbum(query)
      resolvedAlbums.push({
        query,
        albumId: album?.id || null,
        appleId: album?.appleId || null,
        verified: album ? true : false
      })
    }
    
    await albumSeriesStore.updateSeries(series.id, { resolvedAlbums })
  }
}
```

---

## 5. Resumo de Impacto

| Fase | Persistência | CRUD Views | Risco | Esforço |
|------|--------------|------------|-------|---------|
| 5a | Nenhum | Nenhum | Baixo | S |
| 5b | Schema novo | Todos CRUD | Médio | M |
| 5c | Migration | - | Alto (dados legados) | M |

---

## 6. Recomendação Final: Abordagem Incremental

1. **Agora (5a)**: Validation only - impede novos problemas
2. **Próxima sessão (5b)**: Schema upgrade com backward compatibility
3. **Depois (5c)**: Migration das séries existentes

Isso permite que você continue usando o app enquanto fazemos as mudanças incrementalmente.

---

## 7. Alinhamento com Princípios do Constitution

| Princípio | Como CRIT-5 Alinha |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **User-Centric Quality** | Usuário vê álbuns corretos, sem confusão |
| **Clean Code & Modular** | AlbumIdentity model + BaseRepository pattern |
| **Documentation First** | Este documento + specs atualizados |
| **Spec-Driven** | Implementação segue SDD com fases claras |

---

**Status**: Aguardando aprovação do usuário para prosseguir com Fase 5a


# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\sprint13-tech-debt\crit-1-atomic-saves_spec.md
--------------------------------------------------
# Specification: CRIT-1 Atomic Playlist Saves ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## 1. Problem Description
The current `saveToFirestore` implementation in `PlaylistsStore.js` saves playlists individually using `Promise.all()`. 
This is **non-atomic**. If the user has 5 playlists to save and the network cuts out after the 2nd one:
- 2 playlists are saved.
- 3 are lost (or remain dirty locally).
- The state is inconsistent between Client and Server.
- No automatic rollback mechanism exists.

## 2. Goal
Ensure that the "Save to Firestore" operation is **Transactional (Atomic)**. Either ALL playlists in the current series are saved, or NONE are.

## 3. Scope
- **Component**: `PlaylistsStore.js`
- **Method**: `saveToFirestore(db, cacheManager, userId)`
- **Affected Data**: `users/{userId}/curator/playlists` (assuming this is the valid path managed by `PlaylistRepository`).

## 4. Success Criteria
1.  **Atomicity**: Saving N playlists results in exactly N writes in a single batch commit.
2.  **Failure Safety**: If any write in the batch fails, no changes are committed to Firestore.
3.  **UI Feedback**: The user receives a single Success or Error notification for the entire operation.
4.  **Batch Limit Handling**: (Edge Case) If playlists exceed 500 writes (Firestore limit), the operation must be split or guarded (though unlikely for this app's scale).

## 5. Constraints & Risks
- **Firestore Batch Limit**: Max 500 operations per batch.
    - *Mitigation*: We will implement a check. If `playlists.length` > 450, we might need chunking, but for now, we assume < 50 playlists per series.
- **Repository Pattern**: `PlaylistRepository` currently encapsulates `save/create`. We need to expose a way to **add to batch** instead of executing immediately.
    - *Decision*: We will expand `BaseRepository` or `PlaylistRepository` to support `getCreateBatchOperation` / `getSetBatchOperation` OR pass the `batch` object to the repository methods.

## 6. User Review Required
- **Architecture Change**: This requires modifying the `BaseRepository` (or `PlaylistRepository`) pattern to support passing a `WriteBatch` object. Are you comfortable with methods accepting an optional `batch` parameter?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This change prevents partial data loss, which is critical for user trust.



# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\sprint13-tech-debt\crit-2-innerhtml_spec.md
--------------------------------------------------
# Specification: CRIT-2 Remove innerHTML Vulnerabilities ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## 1. Problem Description
The codebase currently uses `innerHTML` in approximately 49 instances across `*Card.js` and `*View.js` files.
Using `innerHTML` with unsanitized data (e.g., user-provided playlist names, track titles) exposes the application to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks.
Additionally, it negatively impacts performance due to browser re-parsing and layout thrashing.

## 2. Goal
Eliminate all instances of `innerHTML` assignment where user input is involved, replacing them with safer alternatives.

## 3. Scope
- **Files**: All files in `public/js/views/` and `public/js/components/`.
- **Method**: Systematic replacement.
- **Exceptions**: If `innerHTML` is strictly necessary (e.g., for rich text rendering), it must be sanitized using `DOMPurify` (though `textContent` is preferred).

## 4. Success Criteria
1.  **Security**: Zero instances of `innerHTML` being assigned valid user-controlled strings without sanitization.
2.  **Functionality**: UI rendering remains textually identical (no breaking of bold tags if they were intended, but usually they shouldn't be in user input).
3.  **Performance**: Slight improvement in rendering performance.

## 5. Implementation Strategy (High Level)
- Use `textContent` for plain text.
- Use `kebab-case` component construction or `document.createElement` if complex HTML structure is needed (or the existing string template literal approach *if* properly escaped, but `innerHTML` itself is the setter to avoid).
- **Note**: Since we use template literals for rendering components (String-based rendering), we rely on `innerHTML` for the initial mount.
    - *Correction*: The issue is likely updating specific elements via `el.innerHTML = ...` or rendering user input inside the template strings without escaping.
    - **Refinement**: The fix often involves using an `escapeHtml` utility function for all variable interpolations in template strings.

## 6. User Review Required
- **Escaping Strategy**: Are you okay with strictly escaping all HTML entities in user content? This (e.g. `<b>bold</b>`) will render as literal text, not bold. (This is desired for security).

--------------------------------------------------
# Specification: CRIT-5 Album Data Pipeline Refactoring

**Status**: 📋 DRAFT - Pending Review
**Created**: 2025-12-25
**Sprint**: 13
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL (Blocks Edit Flow Verification)

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### What is the Problem?

When editing saved playlists, **wrong albums appear** in the series. For example, the "Robert Plant 00-10s" series shows 9 albums instead of 7, including unrelated Led Zeppelin albums ("Physical Graffiti", "Mothership").

Additionally, the **Reconfigure panel** changes are not applied when regenerating playlists.

### Why is it a Problem?

1. **Data Corruption**: Users see albums they didn't add to their series
2. **User Confusion**: Edit flows show unexpected content
3. **Feature Blocked**: Cannot verify Sprint 13 Edit/Reconfigure functionality
4. **Trust Issue**: Users cannot rely on their curated series being accurate

### Root Cause Summary

| # | Issue | Location |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | Cache key (query) ≠ Album identity (actual title) | `albumCache.js`, `client.js` |
| 2 | No validation of Apple Music search results | `client.js` |
| 3 | Global store pollution across series | `albumsStore.js` |

See [album-data-pipeline-analysis.md](album-data-pipeline-analysis.md) for detailed analysis.

---

## 2. Goal

Refactor the album data pipeline to ensure:
1. **Correct album matching**: Only cache albums that match the query with high confidence
2. **Stable identity**: Albums maintain identity across cache/API round-trips
3. **Series isolation**: Editing one series doesn't pollute another

---

## 3. User Stories

### US-1: As a user editing a playlist, I want to see ONLY the albums I added to that series

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Series "Robert Plant 00-10s" shows exactly 7 albums (no Led Zeppelin albums)
- Albums match the original queries stored in `albumQueries`

### US-2: As a user, I want the Reconfigure panel settings to be applied when regenerating

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Changing "Min Tracks per Playlist" affects generated output
- Changing "Ranking Strategy" affects track selection

### US-3: As a user, I want clear feedback when an album cannot be found

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- If Apple Music doesn't have an album, show "Album not found" instead of wrong album
- Low-confidence matches are logged for debugging

---

## 4. Scope

### In Scope

| Component | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| `public/js/api/client.js` | Add similarity validation before caching |
| `public/js/cache/albumCache.js` | Refactor cache key strategy |
| `public/js/controllers/PlaylistsController.js` | Series-scoped album loading |
| `public/js/models/AlbumIdentity.js` | NEW: Stable identity model |

### Out of Scope

- Apple Music artist name alternatives (future enhancement)
- Offline/IndexedDB caching (DEBT-2, separate US)
- BaseCard component (ARCH-3, separate US)

---

## 5. Success Criteria

| # | Criterion | Verification |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | "Robert Plant 00-10s" series shows exactly 7 albums | Manual test |
| 2 | No "Physical Graffiti" or "Mothership" in Robert Plant series | Manual test |
| 3 | Reconfigure panel changes are applied on regenerate | Manual test |
| 4 | Console logs show similarity scores for album matching | Dev verification |
| 5 | Low-confidence matches (<35%) are rejected | Dev verification |

---

## 6. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Breaking existing cached albums | Users see "not found" on reload | Graceful fallback to legacy API |
| Apple Music API rate limiting | Album loading slows down | Keep cache, only reject new mismatches |
| False positives in similarity check | Good albums rejected | Tune threshold, add logging |

---

## 7. Dependencies

| Dependency | Status |
|------------|--------|
| `_calculateSimilarity()` in MusicKitService | ✅ Already exists |
| Album model with stable ID generation | ✅ Already exists |
| PlaylistsController | ✅ Created in ARCH-1 |

---

## 8. User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please review and confirm:
> 1. Is 35% similarity threshold appropriate?
> 2. Should we clear existing cache on deployment?
> 3. Priority relative to ARCH-2, ARCH-3, DEBT-2?

# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\sprint13-tech-debt\debt-2-indexeddb_spec.md
--------------------------------------------------
# Specification: DEBT-2 IndexedDB Persistence

## 1. Problem Description
Currently, `BaseRepository` uses an in-memory `Map` for caching (`CacheManager`).
- **Data Loss**: Refreshing the page clears the cache, forcing re-fetches from Firestore (Latency + Cost).
- **Offline**: App is unusable offline (except for what loaded in current session).

## 2. Goal
Upgrade `CacheManager` or `BaseRepository` to persist the L2 Cache to **IndexedDB**.

## 3. Scope
- **Target**: `public/js/cache/CacheManager.js`
- **Technology**: `idb` (Library) or raw IndexedDB API.
- **Data**: All entities managed by `BaseRepository` (Series, Albums, Playlists).

## 4. Success Criteria
1.  **Persistence**: Data survives page reload.
2.  **Speed**: App load time on second visit is near-instant (no network requests for cached data).
3.  **Transparency**: The rest of the app doesn't know it's loading from IDB vs Memory. `repository.findAll()` just works faster.

## 5. Constraints
- **Versioning**: Schema versioning is handled by `firestore.rules` (sort of), but we need to handle local data staleness.
    - *Strategy*: Simple TTL (Time To Live) is already in `CacheManager`. We just persist it.

## 6. User Review Required
- **Library**: Can we add a tiny dependency like `idb-keyval` (super lightweight) or `idb`, or strictly vanilla JS? (Recommendation: `idb` wrapper for sanity).



# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\sprint13-tech-debt\session_summary_2025_12_25.md
--------------------------------------------------
# Session Summary - December 25, 2025

**Status:** Completed Implementation, Verification Paused.

## 1. Key Achievements

### **Refactoring PlaylistsView (ARCH-1)**
- **Decomposed Monolith:** The massive `PlaylistsView.js` was successfully refactored into a scalable MVC-like architecture:
    - **`PlaylistsController.js`**: Handles business logic, data fetching, and API interactions.
    - **`PlaylistsGridRenderer.js`**: Pure component responsible for generating HTML strings.
    - **`PlaylistsDragHandler.js`**: Encapsulates complex Drag-and-Drop logic (SortableJS).
    - **`PlaylistsView.js`**: Now acts as a lightweight Orchestrator, delegating tasks to the above components.
- **Consolidated UI:**  The legacy `EditPlaylistView.js` functionality was merged into the new `PlaylistsView.js`. The View now intelligently switches between **Create Mode** and **Edit Mode**, providing a consistent experience.
- **UX Improvements:** 
    - "Reconfigure" panel is now available immediately after generation (Create Mode).
    - "Batch Name" input is exposed in Create Mode to facilitate naming before saving.
    - Playlist deletion is unified.

### **Security Hardening (CRIT-2)**
- **XSS Mitigation:** Removed dangerous `innerHTML` usage from critical views:
    - `HomeView.js`
    - `SavedPlaylistsView.js`
    - `SeriesModals.js`
- **Safe Implementation:** Replaced with safe DOM manipulation methods (`document.createElement`, `textContent`, `appendChild`) and `DocumentFragment` for performance.

### **Atomic Saves (CRIT-1)**
- Implemented `runBatchSave` in `PlaylistsStore.js` using Firestore `WriteBatch`.
- Ensures that saving a playlist batch is an all-or-nothing operation, preventing data corruption.

## 2. Issues Encountered & Resolved
- **Missing `render()` method:** `PlaylistsView.js` was missing the mandatory `render()` method. **Fixed.**
- **Hidden Batch Name:** The Batch Name input was previously restricted to Edit Mode only. **Fixed.**
- **Incorrect Playlist Count:** The Regenerate Panel was showing "0 playlists". **Fixed.**
- **Apple Music Auth Loop:** Fixed a bug where export functions were called immediately on render, triggering auth flow in Edit Mode.
- **Disabled Reconfiguration in Edit Mode:** Fixed logic to ensure albums are loaded via `apiClient.fetchMultipleAlbums()` (the V3 API pipeline pattern) when entering Edit Mode directly. This uses the `albumQueries` from the series to fetch full album data with tracks from the backend API.

> **Note**: `OptimizedAlbumLoader` is for search/autocomplete only (no track data). Full album loading uses `apiClient.fetchMultipleAlbums()` which calls Backend `/api/generate`.

## 3. Pending Actions (Next Session)
- **Final Verification:** Resume the browser verification test.
    - Verify Creation Flow (Generate -> Reconfigure -> Name -> Save).
    - Verify Edit Flow (Load -> Rename -> Delete Playlist -> Save).
- **Cleanup:** Delete the deprecated `EditPlaylistView.js` file once verification is confirmed.
- **Git Push:** Push the committed changes to the remote repository.

# IMPL-ARCH-4: Album Search Modularization Plan

**Feature Branch**: `arch-4-album-search-modularization`
**Related Spec**: `arch-4-album-search-modularization_spec.md`
**Status**: DRAFT (Waiting for Approval)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### 1. New Service Module (`public/js/services/album-search/`)
We will move away from the monolithic `MusicKitService.js` by creating a dedicated pipeline.

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `AlbumSearchService.js` | **Orchestrator**. Manages the search flow, fallback strategies, and calling sub-components. |
| `ArtistNormalizer.js` | **Data Transformation**. Maps variations like "Page & Plant" → "Robert Plant & Jimmy Page". |
| `ScoreCalculator.js` | **Logic**. Implements the scoring algorithm (Levenshtein + Penalty modifiers). |
| `EditionFilter.js` | **Filter Logic**. Handles inclusion/exclusion of Deluxe, Live, and Compilation types. |
| `SmartCache.js` | **Performance**. Lightweight in-memory cache for search results (transient). |
| `types.js` | Shared JSDoc type definitions (`SearchResult`, `SearchOptions`). |

### 2. UI Components (`public/js/components/search/`)
To support the new filtering and variant selection without muddying `HomeView.js` further, we will create V3-style components.

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| `DiscographyToolbar.js` | Renders the filter buttons ([Albums] [Singles]...) and Edition toggles. |
| `VariantPickerModal.js` | Renders the "Select Version" popup for albums with multiple editions. |

---

## 🔄 Logic Flows

### A. The Search Pipeline (`AlbumSearchService.search()`)
1.  **Normalization**: Input artist name is passed to `ArtistNormalizer`.
2.  **Strategy 1 (Primary)**: Search Apple Music with normalized artist + album name.
3.  **Validation**: Results passed to `ScoreCalculator`.
    *   *If `confidence > 0.8`*: Return immediately.
4.  **Strategy 2 (Fallback)**: If validation fails, try alternative artist names (e.g., "Led Zeppelin" instead of "Led Zep").
5.  **Strategy 3 (Fuzzy)**: Search Artist only, then fetch their top albums and client-side fuzzy match the title.
6.  **Finalize**: Return sorted, scored list.

### B. Variant Grouping (`AlbumSearchService.groupVariants()`)
1.  Input: List of 50 raw albums.
2.  Logic: Buckets albums by normalized title (ignoring "Deluxe", "Remastered").
3.  Output: List of `AlbumGroup` objects (Base Album + `variants` array).

---

## 🎨 UI Implementation Strategy

Since `HomeView.js` is slated for refactor in ARCH-11, we will implement these changes using **Integration Points** rather than a full rewrite of HomeView now.

### 1. Discography Filters (New DOM Injection)
We will add a container div `#discography-filters` above the results grid in `HomeView`.
`DiscographyToolbar` will mount here.

```javascript
// Data-Flow
Toolbar (User clicks 'Singles') 
  → emits 'filter-change' 
  → HomeView receives event 
  → calls AlbumSearchService.filter(results) 
  → HomeView re-renders Grid
```

### 2. Variant Picking
Instead of immediately adding an album on click:
1.  **Check**: Does album have `variants.length > 0`?
2.  **No**: Proceed with existing "Add to Series" logic.
3.  **Yes**: Open `VariantPickerModal`.
    *   User selects specific version(s).
    *   User clicks "Add".
    *   Modal returns `selectedAlbums`.
    *   HomeView adds them to Series.

---

## 🧪 Verification Plan

### Automated Tests (Unit)
*   **`ArtistNormalizer`**: Test known mappings ("AC/DC" vs "ACDC").
*   **`ScoreCalculator`**: Test Levenshtein distance on tricky pairs ("IV" vs "Physical Graffiti").
*   **`EditionFilter`**: Ensure "Standard" setting filters out "Deluxe Edition".

### Manual Tests (User Scenarios)
1.  **Search "Robert Plant & Jimmy Page - Walking Into Clarksdale"**:
    *   Verify result is NOT "Mothership".
    *   Verify confidence score log > 80%.
2.  **Filter "Led Zeppelin" Discography**:
    *   Toggle [Compilations] → Verify "Mothership" and "Early Days" appear.
    *   Toggle [Albums] → Verify they disappear.
3.  **Variant Picker**:
    *   Click "Led Zeppelin IV".
    *   Verify Modal appears with "Standard", "Remastered", "Deluxe".
    *   Select "Remastered" → verify strictly THAT ID is added to series.

---

--------------------------------------------------
# Feature Specification: ARCH-4 Album Search Pipeline Modularization

**Feature Branch**: `arch-4-album-search-modularization`  
**Created**: 2025-12-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Related Issues**: #92 (Album Cache/Display Flaw), #93 (Reconfigure Panel)

---

## Problem Statement

### What is the Problem?

When searching for albums in Apple Music, the current `MusicKitService.searchAlbums()` frequently returns **wrong albums**. For example:
- Query: "Robert Plant & Jimmy Page - Walking Into Clarksdale"
- Apple Music returns: "Mothership" or "Physical Graffiti" (Led Zeppelin albums)

This causes:
1. Wrong albums cached under original query keys
2. Series show albums that don't belong to them
3. User confusion and data corruption

### Why is it a Problem?

1. **User Trust**: Users cannot rely on their curated series being accurate
2. **Feature Blocked**: Cannot verify Sprint 13 Edit/Reconfigure functionality
3. **Architectural Debt**: Monolithic MusicKitService (692 LOC) mixes search, scoring, and matching

### Root Cause

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Low search limit | Only 10 results returned; correct album may be #11-25 |
| No artist normalization | "Page and Plant" ≠ "Robert Plant & Jimmy Page" |
| Simple scoring | Hardcoded penalties, no fuzzy artist matching |
| No fallback strategy | Single query, no alternatives tried |

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Find Album with Non-Standard Artist Name (Priority: P1)

User searches for an album where the artist name in their query differs from Apple Music's catalog.

**Why this priority**: This is the core bug (#92) causing wrong albums to appear. Highest impact fix.

**Independent Test**: Add "Robert Plant & Jimmy Page - Walking Into Clarksdale" to a series and verify "Walking Into Clarksdale" (not Mothership) is loaded.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user adds "Robert Plant & Jimmy Page - Walking Into Clarksdale" to a series, **When** album is fetched from Apple Music, **Then** "Walking Into Clarksdale" album is returned (confidence > 50%)
2. **Given** artist name is "Page and Plant" (alternative), **When** search fails with exact query, **Then** system tries alternative artist names automatically

---

### User Story 2 - Prefer Standard Edition Over Deluxe/Remaster (Priority: P2)

User searches for a standard album but gets Deluxe Edition variants.

**Why this priority**: Common issue, but doesn't cause "wrong album" - just wrong version.

**Independent Test**: Search for "Led Zeppelin IV" and verify standard edition is prioritized over Deluxe/Super Deluxe.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user searches "Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin IV", **When** results include both standard and deluxe editions, **Then** standard edition scores higher
2. **Given** user explicitly searches "Led Zeppelin IV Deluxe", **When** results include deluxe edition, **Then** deluxe edition is selected

---

### User Story 3 - Clear Feedback When Album Not Found (Priority: P3)

User searches for an album that doesn't exist in Apple Music catalog.

**Why this priority**: UX improvement, not critical bug.

**Independent Test**: Search for an obscure album and verify a "Not Found" message is shown instead of returning a random album.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** album does not exist in Apple Music, **When** all search strategies fail, **Then** return null with reason "Album not found" (not a random album)
2. **Given** low-confidence match (< 35%), **When** best result is selected, **Then** console logs similarity score for debugging

---

### User Story 4 - Filter Artist Discography by Album Type (Priority: P2)

User types an artist name in HomeView and wants to filter the discography grid by type (Albums, Singles, Compilations, Live).

**Why this priority**: Improves existing flow without breaking it. Commonly needed for artists with large catalogs.

**Independent Test**: Search "Led Zeppelin", toggle "Albums only" filter, verify only studio albums appear (no compilations/singles).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user searches artist "Led Zeppelin" in HomeView, **When** discography loads, **Then** filter buttons appear: [Albums] [Singles] [Compilations] [Live]
2. **Given** filter "Albums" is active, **When** results render, **Then** only items with `albumType === 'Album'` are shown
3. **Given** user toggles multiple filters, **When** re-render, **Then** results match ALL active filters

---

### User Story 5 - Load All Artist Albums with Pagination (Priority: P3)

User searches an artist with 100+ albums (e.g., Beatles) and currently only sees first 100.

**Why this priority**: Edge case for artists with huge catalogs. Current limit=100 is usually sufficient.

**Independent Test**: Search "Beatles", verify "Load More" button appears if more albums exist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** artist has > 100 albums, **When** initial load completes, **Then** "Load More" button appears with count (e.g., "Showing 100 of 150")
2. **Given** user clicks "Load More", **When** next page loads, **Then** new albums append to grid (not replace)

---

### User Story 6 - Select Album Variant (Deluxe/Remaster/Standard) (Priority: P2)

User sees multiple versions of the same album (Standard, Deluxe, Remastered) and wants to choose which one(s) to add.

**Why this priority**: Gives user control over which version to blend. Prevents unwanted Deluxe tracks.

**Independent Test**: Search "Led Zeppelin", click on "Led Zeppelin IV" which has 3 variants, verify popup shows all variants.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** album has multiple variants in catalog, **When** discography renders, **Then** album card shows badge "🔻 3 versions"
2. **Given** user clicks album with variants, **When** popup opens, **Then** all variants are listed with: name, year, track count
3. **Given** user selects specific variant(s), **When** clicks "Add", **Then** ONLY selected variants go to Staging Area
4. **Given** user clicks "Add All", **When** popup closes, **Then** ALL variants are added to Staging Area

---

### User Story 7 - Filter by Edition Type (Standard/Remaster/Deluxe) (Priority: P3)

User wants to see only Standard editions OR only Remasters in the discography grid.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have filtering, complements US-6.

**Independent Test**: Search "Pink Floyd", enable "Remasters only", verify only remastered editions appear.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** edition filter "Standard" is active, **When** results render, **Then** albums with "(Deluxe)", "(Remastered)" in name are hidden
2. **Given** edition filter "Remasters" is active, **When** results render, **Then** only albums with "(Remastered)" in name are shown

---

### Edge Cases

- **Special characters in names**: "AC/DC", "Guns N' Roses", "Earth, Wind & Fire"
- **Roman numerals vs numbers**: "Led Zeppelin IV" vs "Led Zeppelin 4"
- **Multiple artists**: "Santana feat. Rob Thomas" vs "Santana & Rob Thomas"
- **Self-titled albums**: "Led Zeppelin" (artist) - "Led Zeppelin" (album)

---

## Technical Approach (Reference)

> [!NOTE]
> This section captures technical details from analysis. Full implementation in `plan.md` phase.

### Proposed Modular Architecture

```
public/js/services/
├── MusicKitService.js         # DEPRECATED → rename to MusicKitServiceLegacy.js
├── MusicKitServiceV2.js       # Clean rewrite with modular architecture
│
└── album-search/              # NEW: Modular search components
    ├── AlbumSearchService.js      # Orchestrator with fallback strategies
    ├── AlbumScorer.js             # Scoring logic (extracted)
    ├── ArtistNormalizer.js        # Artist name variations
    ├── EditionFilter.js           # Deluxe/Remaster/Live filtering
    ├── SimilarityMatcher.js       # String similarity (Levenshtein)
    ├── AlbumVariantGrouper.js     # Groups same album versions
    └── index.js                   # Barrel export
```

### Key Components

#### 1. EditionFilter.js
```javascript
// Cleans album name for searching + calculates penalties
cleanQuery("Led Zeppelin IV (Super Deluxe)") → "Led Zeppelin IV"
calculatePenalty({ isDeluxe: true }, { wantsDeluxe: false }) → 50
```

#### 2. SimilarityMatcher.js (Levenshtein)
```javascript
calculate("walking into clarksdale", "walking in clarksdale") → 0.91 (91%)
calculate("walking into clarksdale", "physical graffiti") → 0.15 (rejected)
isMatch(s1, s2, threshold=0.35) → true/false
```

#### 3. ArtistNormalizer.js
```javascript
getAlternatives("Page and Plant") → ["jimmy page & robert plant", "robert plant & jimmy page"]
getAlternatives("Led Zep") → ["led zeppelin"]
```

#### 4. AlbumVariantGrouper.js
```javascript
group([LZ IV, LZ IV (Remastered), LZ IV (Deluxe), Physical Graffiti])
→ {
    "led zeppelin iv": [Original, Remastered, Deluxe],
    "physical graffiti": [Physical Graffiti]
  }
```

---

### Implementation Phases (CRIT-5)

#### Phase 5a: Validation Only (Low Impact)
- Add similarity check in `apiClient.fetchAlbum()`
- Reject low-confidence matches (< 35%)
- No schema changes, no persistence impact

#### Phase 5b: Schema Upgrade (Medium Impact)
```javascript
// Firestore Series Schema
{
  albumQueries: ["Artist - Album", ...],        // Kept for compatibility
  resolvedAlbums: [                              // NEW
    { query: "...", albumId: "...", appleId: "...", verified: true }
  ]
}
```

#### Phase 5c: Migration (One-time)
- Script to resolve existing series' albumQueries
- Add resolvedAlbums to each series

---

### MusicKitService Changes

#### getArtistAlbums() - Add Pagination
```javascript
async getArtistAlbums(artistName, options = {}) {
    let allAlbums = []
    let offset = 0
    const limit = 100
    
    while (true) {
        const result = await this.music.api.music(
            `/v1/catalog/${this._getStorefront()}/artists/${artistId}/albums`,
            { limit, offset }  // ← Pagination
        )
        const albums = result.data?.data || []
        allAlbums.push(...albums)
        if (albums.length < limit) break
        offset += limit
    }
    
    return this._mapAndClassify(allAlbums)
}
```

#### searchAlbums() - Increase Limit
```javascript
async searchAlbums(artist, album, limit = 50) {  // Changed from 10
    // ... existing code with better scoring
}
```

---

## Out of Scope

- Apple Music artist name alternatives database (future enhancement)
- Offline/IndexedDB caching (DEBT-2, separate spec)
- BestEver scraper modularization (separate spec)
- Spotify search integration (already handled by SpotifyService)

---

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Status |
|------------|--------|
| MusicKit JS v3 | ✅ Already integrated |
| Levenshtein similarity function | ✅ Already in MusicKitService |
| Strategy Pattern implementation | ✅ Model exists in ranking/ |

---

## Status: Awaiting User Review

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please review this specification and confirm:
> 1. Are the User Stories correctly prioritized (P1-P3)?
> 2. Is the 35% confidence threshold appropriate?
> 3. Should we add more artist name variations?
> 4. Filters visible always or as expandable panel?
> 5. Variant picker: modal popup or inline expansion?
> 6. Pagination: auto-load or manual "Load More" button?

--------------------------------------------------
# ARCH-7: Operation Safe Text Implementation Plan (COMPLETED)

**Spec**: [arch-7-security-hardening_spec.md](arch-7-security-hardening_spec.md)

## Goal
Eliminate `innerHTML` usage in Modals and consolidate `escapeHtml` to `utils/stringUtils.js`.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. New Utility Module
#### [NEW] `public/js/utils/stringUtils.js`
- Export `escapeHtml(str)`
- Export `safeHtml(str)` (optional, for later)

### 2. Refactor Modals
#### [MODIFY] `public/js/components/Modals.js`
- Import `escapeHtml` from `../utils/stringUtils.js`
- Remove local `escapeHtml` function
- **Pattern Change**: For dynamic content, use `textContent` where possible or strictly escaped strings.
  - `showDeleteSeriesModal`
  - `showEditSeriesModal`
  - `showDeleteAlbumModal`
  - `showDeletePlaylistModal`
  - `showDeleteBatchModal`
  - `showSavePlaylistsModal`

#### [MODIFY] `public/js/components/InventoryModals.js`
- Same pattern application.

#### [MODIFY] `public/js/components/series/SeriesModals.js`
- Same pattern application.

#### [MODIFY] Other Files (Cleanup)
- `public/js/components/ConfirmationModal.js`
- `public/js/components/EditAlbumModal.js`
- `public/js/components/ViewAlbumModal.js`
- `public/js/components/Toast.js`
- `public/js/views/renderers/AlbumsGridRenderer.js`
- `public/js/views/renderers/AlbumsScopedRenderer.js`
- Update all to import `escapeHtml` from utils.

### 3. Extended Audit (Added post-implementation)
- `public/js/views/BaseView.js` (Method removed)
- `public/js/views/HomeView.js`
- `public/js/views/SeriesView.js`
- `public/js/views/SavedPlaylistsView.js`
- `public/js/views/RankingView.js`
- `public/js/views/InventoryView.js`
- `public/js/views/ConsolidatedRankingView.js`
- `public/js/views/PlaylistsView.js`
- `public/js/views/BlendingMenuView.js`
- `public/js/components/playlists/PlaylistsGridRenderer.js`
- `public/js/components/playlists/PlaylistCard.js`
- `public/js/components/playlists/TrackItem.js`

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. **Delete Series Modal**:
   - Open modal. Check bold series name renders as text, not HTML tags.
   - Try to inject `<b>Bold</b>` in series name -> should show `<b>Bold</b>`.
2. **Edit Series Modal**:
   - Edit name, check input value hygiene.
3. **Inventory Modals**:
   - Verify specific inventory actions (Edit Price, etc).

### Automated Tests
- None currently for UI, relying on manual regression testing.



# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\sprint14-clean-arch\arch-7-security-hardening_spec.md
--------------------------------------------------
# ARCH-7: Operation Safe Text (Security Hardening)

**Date**: 2025-12-26  
**Status**: 📋 SPECIFICATION  
**Sprint**: 14  
**Impact**: High (Security/Tech Debt)

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### Security Vulnerability
The codebase currently has **50+ instances of `innerHTML`** usage, primarily in Modals and Views. This exposes the application to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if user-generated content (like playlist names or descriptions) is not strictly sanitized.

### Code Hygiene
There are **8 duplicate `escapeHtml` functions** scattered across the codebase, leading to maintenance issues and potential inconsistencies in how text is escaped.

### Goals
1. eliminate `innerHTML` usage where dynamic content is involved.
2. consolidate text escaping logic into a single utility.
3. standardize text injection using `textContent` for safety.

---

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR1**: Create a `utils/stringUtils.js` module with `escapeHtml` and `safeText` helpers.
- **FR2**: Refactor all Modals to use `textContent` instead of string interpolation + `innerHTML`.
  - Priority targets: `Modals.js`, `InventoryModals.js`, `SeriesModals.js`.
- **FR3**: Replace all 8 duplicate `escapeHtml` definitions with imports from the new utility.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1**: Zero functional regressions in UI rendering (modals must look identical).
- **NFR2**: Zero performance degradation.

---

## 3. Success Criteria

| ID | Criteria | Validation |
|----|----------|------------|
| **SC1** | No duplicate `escapeHtml` functions remain | `grep -r "function escapeHtml" public/js` returns only 1 result |
| **SC2** | Modals render correctly without `innerHTML` | Manual verification of Create/Edit/Delete modals |
| **SC3** | XSS vector closed in Modals | Attempt to inject `<script>` in playlist name → renders as text |

---

## 4. Out of Scope

- Sanitizing `innerHTML` where HTML is *required* (e.g., rich text descriptions). For now, we focus on where it's *not* required.
- Refactoring huge Views (InventoryView) - handled in ARCH-8.

# ARCH-8: InventoryView V3 Refactor Implementation Plan

**Spec**: [arch-8-inventory-refactor_spec.md](arch-8-inventory-refactor_spec.md)

## Goal
Decouple `InventoryView.js` into Controller + Renderer pattern.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Create Controller
#### [NEW] `public/js/controllers/InventoryController.js`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Load albums from `inventoryStore`
  - Handle filtering logic (`filterAlbums`)
  - Handle sorting logic (if any)
  - Handle CRUD delegation (`updatePrice`, `updateStatus`, `deleteAlbum`)
  - Manage selection state (`selectedAlbums` Set)
  - **Dependencies**: `inventoryStore`, `albumLoader`

### 2. Create Renderer
#### [NEW] `public/js/views/renderers/InventoryGridRenderer.js`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - `render(state)`: Main entry
  - `renderGrid(albums)`
  - `renderList(albums)`
  - `renderAlbumCard(album)`
  - `renderAlbumRow(album)`
  - `renderFormatBadge(format)`
  - `renderEmptyState()`
  - Helpers: `formatCurrency`, `getAlbumCoverUrl`
- **Dependencies**: `getIcon`, `escapeHtml`

### 3. Refactor View
#### [MODIFY] `public/js/views/InventoryView.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Instantiate `this.controller` and `this.renderer`
  - `mount()`: Delegate data loading to controller
  - `render()`: Call `renderer.render(controller.state)`
  - `attachEventListeners()`: bind events to controller methods
  - Remove all DOM generation methods
  - Remove direct store access (go through controller)

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. **Load Inventory**: Verify grid/list view renders correctly.
2. **Filtering**: SEARCH for an album, filter by FORMAT (Vinyl), filter by OWNERSHIP.
3. **Selection**: Click checkboxes, verify "Create Series" button appears.
4. **Context Actions**:
   - Changed "Owned" status dropdrown.
   - Edit Price (inline).
   - Delete Album.
5. **Drag & Drop**: (If applicable, though Inventory doesn't seem to have D&D yet per analysis, checking code...)
   - *Correction*: Code analysis shows no SortableJS in InventoryView. Just simple grid.

### Automated Tests
- No existing unit tests for views.
- Will rely on manual verification "Smoke Test".

# ARCH-8: InventoryView V3 Refactor

**Date**: 2025-12-26  
**Status**: 📋 SPECIFICATION  
**Sprint**: 14  
**Impact**: High (Maintainability)

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### The Monolith Issue
`InventoryView.js` has grown to **742 LOC**, becoming a "God Class" that handles:
- UI Rendering (HTML generation)
- Business Logic (CRUD operations)
- State Management (Filtering, Sorting)
- Modal Coordination
- Drag and Drop

This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the inventory feature fragile and hard to test.

### Goals
Apply the proven **V3 Architecture** (successfully used in `SeriesView` and `PlaylistsView`) to the Inventory system.

---

## 2. Proposed Architecture

### Components
1. **InventoryController**: Pure business logic, state management, interactions with `inventoryStore`.
2. **InventoryGridRenderer**: Handles HTML generation for the album grid.
3. **InventoryView**: Thin orchestrator, handles DOM events and lifecycle.

### Data Flow
```
User Action → View → Controller → Store → Repository → Firestore
                         ↓
                      View Update (via Renderer)
```

---

## 3. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR1**: Extract all logic to `InventoryController.js`.
- **FR2**: Extract HTML generation to `InventoryGridRenderer.js`.
- **FR3**: `InventoryView.js` must effectively be reduced to < 300 LOC.
- **FR4**: Preserve all existing functionality (CRUD, Filters, Sorting, Drag & Drop).

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1**: `InventoryController` must have **Zero DOM references**.
- **NFR2**: UI responsiveness must maintain or improve (no unnecessary re-renders).

---

## 4. Success Criteria

| ID | Criteria | Validation |
|----|----------|------------|
| **SC1** | `InventoryView.js` < 400 LOC | LOC count check |
| **SC2** | `InventoryController` DOM-free | Static analysis / code review |
| **SC3** | No regressions in features | Manual test of Add/Edit/Delete/Filter |

---

## 5. Risks

- **Drag & Drop**: Often fragile during refactors. Needs specific regression testing.
- **Modal connection**: Ensuring modals still wire up correctly to the new controller.

```

---

## 5. Mobile Responsiveness (Implemented)

- **Stacking**: Panels stack vertically (left on top, right below)
- **Filters**: Horizontal scroll with hidden scrollbar
- **Breadcrumbs**: Hidden on screens < 640px
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for buttons
- **Right Panel**: `min-h-[50vh]` ensures visibility

---

## 6. Post-Implementation Notes

### What Worked Well
- Split-panel layout provides clear separation of concerns
- Event delegation solved fragile onclick handlers
- Client-side filtering provides instant UX feedback

### Lessons Learned
- Data model consistency critical (object vs string albumQueries)
- Mobile-first approach needed earlier
- Hover interactions don't translate to mobile (always-visible buttons)

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] "Selected" state indicator on album cards
- [ ] Flying animation when staging albums
- [ ] Artist autocomplete in search
- [ ] Bulk mode: real-time line resolution with checkmarks

# Plan: HomeView V3 Restoration & UX Polish

**Feature**: HomeView V3 Refactor (ARCH-11) - Phase 2: Functional Parity & UX
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-28
**Related Spec**: `arch-11-home-v3-spec.md`
**Tasks**: `tasks.md`

## 1. Goal
Restore core functionalities (Filters, Staging) lost during the V3 refactor and improve the UX for Search and Staging interactions. Achieve parity with the previous version using the new V3 architecture and "Nano/Flame" aesthetic.

**Outcome**: All goals achieved. HomeView V3 is fully functional with improved UX.

## 2. Architecture & Logic Flows (Implemented)

### 2.1 Search & Filter Pipeline
Client-side filtering with cached results.

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[User Input] -->|Type + Click Scan| Search[SearchController.searchArtist]
    Search -->|API Call| API[AlbumSearchService.getArtistDiscography]
    API -->|Processed Results| Cache[this.results Cache]
    
    FilterUI[Filter Buttons: Studio/Singles/Live/Compilations] -->|Click| Toggle[toggleFilter]
    Toggle --> Apply[applyFilters]
    Cache --> Apply
    
    Apply -->|Type Detection: isSingle, isLive, isCompilation| Filtered[Filtered List]
    Filtered -->|Sort: Newest First| Sorted[Sorted List]
    Sorted -->|Render| Renderer[DiscographyRenderer]
```

### 2.2 Staging Interaction (Event Delegation)
Fixed using direct event registration instead of inline handlers.

```mermaid
graph TD
    User -->|Click Album Card| Grid[#discographyGrid]
    Grid -->|addEventListener click| HC[HomeController.handleGridClick]
    
    HC -->|closest data-action| Dataset[data-id extraction]
    HC -->|Find album| Cache[SearchController.results]
    
    HC -->|addAlbum| StagingCtrl[StagingAreaController]
    StagingCtrl -->|Update State| State[selectedAlbums array]
    StagingCtrl -->|Render| StagingRenderer[StagingAreaRenderer]
```

### 2.3 Initialize Load Sequence (New)
Full series creation workflow.

```mermaid
graph TD
    User -->|Click Initialize| Btn[#btnInitializeLoad]
    Btn --> Handler[HomeController.handleInitializeLoad]
    
    Handler -->|Get albums| Staging[stagingController.getSelectedAlbums]
    Handler -->|Get name| Input[#seriesNameInput.value]
    
    Handler -->|Create| Store[albumSeriesStore.createSeries]
    Store -->|Returns| Series[newSeries with ID]
    
    Handler -->|Navigate| Router[router.navigate /albums/:id]
    Router --> View[SeriesView with new series]
```

## 3. UI/UX Strategy (Implemented)

### 3.1 Labels & Sections
Restored intuitive labels matching UI Style Guide:
- **01 // Series Configuration** + sublabel "Your Albums Series Name"
- **02a // Artist Filter** (replaced technical "INPUT METHOD")
- **03 // Selected Albums** (replaced jargon "STAGING STACK")

### 3.2 Filter Toolbar (Right Panel)
```
[ Discography Scan > Artist Name ]   [Studio] [Singles/EP] [Live] [Compilations]
                                     (Active=Orange gradient, Inactive=Gray)
```

### 3.3 Scan Button
- Visible orange gradient button "Scan" next to input
- Replaces hidden icon-only button

### 3.4 Mobile Responsiveness
- Panels stack vertically
- Filters scroll horizontally with hidden scrollbar
- Breadcrumbs hidden on small screens

### 3.5 Staging Area
- Remove button always visible (not hover-dependent)
- Larger touch target with red background
- X icon rendered via `getIcon('X')`

# Componentization Audit & Strategy (ARCH-12)

**Severity**: CRITICAL (Reusability < 6%)
**Date**: 2025-12-28
**Context**: User identified "Grand Problem" regarding lack of modular reuse.

## 🚨 The Findings

### 1. The "BaseCard" Illusion
Although `BaseCard.js` exists, it is widely ignored or misused:
-   **Misuse**: `BatchGroupCard` imports it but uses it only as a *Utility Class* (for `escapeHtml`), not inheriting behavior.
-   **Ignored**: `SeriesCard` and `AlbumCard` do not use it at all.
-   **Inversion**: `EntityCard.js` (Component) calls `AlbumsGridRenderer.js` (View Logic) to render HTML. This is backwards dependency.

### 2. Fragmentation of Shared Code
We have 3 directories for "Shared" code, with no clear distinction:
-   `components/base/` (BaseCard, Component)
-   `components/shared/` (SkeletonLoader, ContextMenu)
-   `components/common/` (AlbumCascade)

### 3. Logic Duplication (The "Copy-Paste" Pattern)
Critical UI patterns are implemented 4-5 times independently:
-   **Track Rows**: `SavedPlaylistsView` manually builds track DOMs. `RankingsView` likely does the same. `BlendingView` too.
-   **Modals**: `SavedPlaylistsView` contains hardcoded HTML for 3 modals inside its `render()` string.

---

## 🏗️ The Plan: Unified Component System (Sprint 15)

### Phase 1: Establish the Core (Sprint 15.1)
1.  **Consolidate Directories**: Move all shared UI to `components/ui/`.
    *   `src/components/ui/Card.js`
    *   `src/components/ui/Button.js`
    *   `src/components/ui/Modal.js`
2.  **Create Atomic Atoms**:
    *   `TrackRow.js`: Determines how a track looks everywhere.
    *   `AlbumArt.js`: Handles lazy loading and placeholders.

### Phase 2: Refactor "God Views" (Sprint 15.2)
1.  **SavedPlaylistsView**:
    *   Replace hardcoded Modals with `BaseModal` imports.
    *   Replace manual Track rendering with `TrackRow.render()`.
2.  **AlbumsGridRenderer**:
    *   Refactor to use new `Card` component instead of string concatenation.

### Phase 3: Enforce Usage
-   **Rule**: Views MUST NOT contain `class="track-row..."` or generic HTML structures. They must import Components.

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps
1.  **Move** `BaseCard.js` to `components/ui/Card.js`.
2.  **Create** `components/ui/TrackRow.js`.
3.  **Refactor** `SavedPlaylistsView` to use `TrackRow` as a proof-of-concept.

# Phase 6 Hotfix Plan: Edit Modal Search + Storefront

**Date**: 2025-12-31
**Sprint**: 15 Phase 6
**Issue**: #113

## Goals
1. Unify search logic between Home and Edit modal
2. Implement lazy authorize (browser locale for search, authorize on persist)
3. Deprecate Autocomplete in favor of artist scan + filters

## Storefront Strategy

| Step | Storefront Source | Authorize? |
|------|------------------|------------|
| Search/Scan | Browser locale | ❌ |
| Preview results | Browser locale | ❌ |
| Persist to Firestore | Apple Music account | ✅ |

**Mismatch handling**: If browser !== Apple storefront, re-fetch with correct ID.

---

## Changes

### 1. MusicKitService.js
- Add `getBrowserStorefront()`: Parse `navigator.language` → storefront code
- Remove `authorize()` from `_doInit()` (lazy)
- Keep `_waitForStorefront()` but use browser locale fallback
- Add `validateStorefront()`: Called on persist, detects mismatch

### 2. SeriesModals.js
- Replace Autocomplete input with:
  - Artist input + "Scan" button
  - Filter buttons (Albums/Singles/Live/Compilations)
  - Compact list results
- Use `albumSearchService.getArtistDiscography()` (same as Home)
- On album add: Call `authorize()` + `validateStorefront()`

### 3. Deprecations
- `Autocomplete.js` → Add deprecated comment header
- `MusicKitSearchAdapter.js` → Add deprecated comment header

## Verification
1. Test search with browser locale (no authorize popup)
2. Test adding album triggers authorize
3. Test storefront mismatch warning
4. Test "trex" finds results in Edit modal

--------------------------------------------------
# Sprint 15 Plan: Safely Componentized Architecture (ARCH-12)

**Goal**: Define the Architecture for the Unified Component System, Security Foundation, and Refactor Pilot.
**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md) | **Tasks**: [tasks.md](./tasks.md)

---

## 1. Directory Structure (Clean Architecture)

```
src/
  components/
    ui/                  # <--- THE NEW CORE
      Card.js            # Universal Card (Grid/List)
      TrackRow.js        # Universal Track (Row/Item)
      BaseModal.js       # Universal Modal Shell
    
    # Legacy Cleanup Targets:
    # - base/ (Delete)
    # - shared/ (Delete)
    # - common/ (Delete)
  
  utils/
    SafeDOM.js           # <--- NEW: Safe DOM Builder
```

## 2. The Strategy: "Security First, Then Migration"
We identified that copying insecure components (`innerHTML`) to multiple views increases technical debt.

**New Flow**:
1.  **Harden**: Create `SafeDOM` and upgrade `Card`/`TrackRow`.
2.  **Migrate**: Apply SAFE components to legacy views.

---

## 3. Technical Architecture

### A. The `SafeDOM` Utility
A fluent, chainable API for DOM creation that forbids `innerHTML`.

```javascript
// public/js/utils/SafeDOM.js
export const SafeDOM = {
  // Primary Factory
  create(tag, props = {}, children = []) {
    const el = document.createElement(tag);
    
    // Props
    Object.entries(props).forEach(([key, val]) => {
      if (key === 'className') el.className = val;
      else if (key === 'style' && typeof val === 'object') Object.assign(el.style, val);
      else if (key.startsWith('on') && typeof val === 'function') {
        el.addEventListener(key.substring(2).toLowerCase(), val);
      }
      else if (key === 'dataset') Object.assign(el.dataset, val);
      else el.setAttribute(key, val);
    });

    // Children (Automatic Text Safety)
    const kids = Array.isArray(children) ? children : [children];
    kids.forEach(child => {
      if (!child) return;
      if (typeof child === 'string' || typeof child === 'number') {
        el.appendChild(document.createTextNode(String(child))); // SAFE
      } else if (child instanceof Node) {
        el.appendChild(child);
      }
    });

    return el;
  },

  // Helpers
  div(props, children) { return this.create('div', props, children); },
  button(props, children) { return this.create('button', props, children); },
  span(props, children) { return this.create('span', props, children); },
  img(props) { return this.create('img', props); },
  
  clear(el) {
    while (el.firstChild) el.removeChild(el.firstChild);
  }
};
```

### B. Upgraded Component Pattern
Components will export a `render()` function that returns a `DOM Node`, not a string.

**Old (Card.js)**:
```javascript
return `<div class="card">${escapeHtml(data.title)}</div>` // String
```

**New (Card.js)**:
```javascript
import { SafeDOM } from '../utils/SafeDOM.js';

export class Card {
  static render(data) {
    return SafeDOM.div({ className: 'card' }, [
      SafeDOM.div({ className: 'card-title' }, data.title), // Safe text
      SafeDOM.img({ src: data.img, alt: data.title })      // Safe attr
    ]);
  }
}
```

---

## 4. Component API Design

### A. `Card.js` (The Universal Entity)
Replaces `BaseCard`, `EntityCard`, `AlbumsGridRenderer` cards.

```javascript
export class Card {
    /**
     * @param {Object} props
     * @param {Object} props.entity - The data object (Album, Playlist)
     * @param {'grid' | 'list' | 'minimal'} [props.variant='grid']
     * @param {Array<{icon: string, label: string, action: string}>} [props.actions]
     * @param {Function} [props.onClick]
     */
    static render(props) { ... }
}
```

### B. `TrackRow.js` (The Universal List Item)
Replaces `TrackItem.js` (Playlists) and manual HTML (Rankings, SavedPlaylists).

#### Gap Analysis & Superset Strategy
| Feature | `TrackItem.js` (Legacy) | `RankingView` (Manual) | `TrackRow.js` (New) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Drag Handle** | ✅ (If draggable) | ❌ | **✅ (`draggable` prop)** |
| **Medals (🥇)** | ❌ | ✅ (Top 3) | **✅ (`ranking` variant)** |
| **Rank Badges** | ✅ (Acclaim/Spotify) | ✅ (Custom Colors) | **✅ (Unified Logic)** |
| **Duration** | ✅ | ✅ | **✅** |
| **CSS Class** | `.track-item` | `.track-row` | **`.track-row`** (Updates required in DragDrop) |

#### API Definition
```javascript
export class TrackRow {
    /**
     * @param {Object} props
     * @param {Object} props.track - The track data
     * @param {number} props.index - Visual index (1, 2, 3...)
     * @param {'compact' | 'detailed' | 'ranking'} [props.variant='compact']
     * @param {Array<{action: string, icon: string}>} [props.actions]
     * @param {boolean} [props.draggable=false] - Shows grip handle
     * @param {Object} [props.meta] - Extra data (e.g. { ratingClass: 'badge-success' })
     */
    static render(props) { ... }
}
```

### C. `BaseModal.js`
Standardizes the "Glass Panel" look and close behavior.

---

## 5. Component Migration Map

| Component | Current State | Target State | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Card.js` | ⚠️ innerHTML (String) | ✅ SafeDOM (Node) | Used in SavedPlaylists |
| `TrackRow.js` | ⚠️ innerHTML (String) | ✅ SafeDOM (Node) | Used in SavePlaylists |
| `BaseModal.js` | ⚠️ innerHTML (String) | ✅ SafeDOM (Node) | Basic shell |

---

## 6. Architecture: SavedPlaylistsView Refactor

**Pattern**: Controller-View (Separation of Concerns).

### A. The Controller (`SavedPlaylistsController.js`)
Responsible for:
1.  Fetching Series & Playlists (Repositories).
2.  Managing Store Context (setting active Series).
3.  Handling Deletions (Business Logic).
4.  Navigation Routing.

### B. The View (`SavedPlaylistsView.js`)
Responsible for:
1.  **Rendering only**: Uses `Card.js` variants and `TrackRow.js`.
2.  **Event Delegation**: Captures clicks and delegates to Controller.
3.  **No Business Logic**.

---

## 7. Rollout Strategy
1.  **Stop the bleeding**: No new `innerHTML` code.
2.  **Vaccinate the core**: Rewrite `Card`, `TrackRow`, `BaseModal` using `SafeDOM`.
3.  **Heal the limbs**: Refactor Views one by one to use the vaccinated components.

---

## 8. Risk Management
*   **Performance**: `document.createElement` is generally faster than `innerHTML` parsing for small updates, but slower for massive initial renders.
    *   *Mitigation*: Use `DocumentFragment` for lists (e.g., rendering 500 tracks). `SafeDOM` should handle fragments if array passed.
*   **Developer Friction**: Writing DOM definitions is more verbose than HTML strings.
    *   *Mitigation*: Keep `SafeDOM` API terse (`SafeDOM.div` vs `create('div')`).

---

## 9. Security Validation
*   **Rule**: No `innerHTML` interpolation of user data.
*   **Method**: `Card` and `TrackRow` must use safe DOM construction or strict escaping.

---

## 10. UI Mockups (Unchanged)
The visual output remains identical. This is a purely structural refactor to eliminate XSS vectors.



# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025-12\sprint15-arch12\spec.md
--------------------------------------------------
# Sprint 15 Specification: Structural Integrity (ARCH-12)

**Goal**: Unified Component System & Technical Debt Elimination
**Context**: "Grand Problem" of Reusability (<6%) and Security Sinks.

## 1. Why Componentization? Why Now?
*   **Problem**: We have 3 "Shared" folders (`base`, `shared`, `common`) but none are truly standard.
*   **Consequence**: Every View implements its own "Card" and "Track Row" HTML.
*   **Vision**: "Write Once, Update Everywhere". If we change the Album Card design in `Card.js`, it updates Home, Series, and Search results instantly.

## 2. Security Policy: The "Zero Tolerance" Shift
**User Question**: *"Why can't we keep innerHTML? It was strategic for speed."*
**Answer**:
*   **Prototype (v1-v2)**: Speed > Security.
*   **Product (v3)**: Security > Speed. `innerHTML` is an XSS vector.
*   **Benefit**: 100% XSS immunity and faster VDOM-like updates.

## 3. Component Standard: TrackRow Logic

### Current State (The Problem)
*Inconsistent patterns (`track-item` class vs `track-row` class).*
```javascript
// SavedPlaylistsView.js (Uses 'track-item')
row.innerHTML = `<div class="track-item ...">${escapeHtml(title)}</div>`;

// RankingView.js (Uses 'track-row')
html += `<div class="track-row ...">${escapeHtml(name)}</div>`;
```

### Proposed State (The Solution)
*Implemented once in `src/components/ui/TrackRow.js`*
```javascript
import { TrackRow } from '../components/ui/TrackRow.js';

// Works everywhere
const row = TrackRow.render({
    track: track,
    index: i + 1,
    variant: 'compact',
    actions: ['play', 'remove']
});
```

## 4. Feature Audit: SavedPlaylistsView (Goal: 100% Parity)
*We must preserve EVERY feature listed below exactly as it behaves today.*

### A. Data & Loading
- [ ] **Repositories**: `SeriesRepository` (find all), `PlaylistRepository` (find by series).
- [ ] **Stores**: `playlistsStore` (editing context), `albumSeriesStore` (series context), `albumsStore` (series context).
- [ ] **Loading States**: Spinner (`renderLoading`) vs Content (`renderContent`).
- [ ] **Empty State**: "No Playlists Found" + CTA Button to Home.

### B. Grouping & Sorting Logic
- [ ] **Series Grouping**: Top level is Series.
- [ ] **Batch Grouping**:
    -   Playlists with same `batchName` are grouped under one Header.
    -   Default batch: "Saved Playlists".
- [ ] **Sorting Rules**:
    1.  **Batches**: Sorted by `savedAt` (Newest first).
    2.  **Playlists**: Sorted by `order` property (ASC).
    3.  **Fallback**: Sorted by `name` (Numeric string sort).

### C. Visual Elements
- [ ] **Header**: Breadcrumbs (/saved-playlists) + Icon + Title.
- [ ] **Batch Card (`BatchGroupCard`)**:
    -   Thumbnail Cascade (uses `optimizedAlbumLoader` to find covers).
    -   Metadata: Playlist Count, Track Count, Album Count, Duration, Date.
    -   **Collapse/Expand**: Header click toggles playlist list visibility.
- [ ] **Playlist Row**:
    -   Chevron (Expand/Collapse tracks).
    -   Thumbnail (First album art or generic disc).
    -   Metadata: Name, Track count, Duration.
    -   **Hover Actions**: View Details (Eye icon).

### D. Actions & Modals
- [ ] **Edit Series**: Button `[Edit Series]` -> Navigate to `/playlists?seriesId=X`.
    -   *Crucial*: Must set `albumsStore.activeSeriesId`.
- [ ] **Add Playlists**: Button `[Add Playlists]` -> Navigate to `/blend`.
- [ ] **Edit Batch**: Button `[Edit Batch]` -> Navigate to `/playlists/edit`.
- [ ] **Delete All Playlists**:
    -   Triggers local `deleteModal` (HTML hardcoded in View currently).
    -   Logic: Deletes all playlists, Keeps Series.
- [ ] **Delete Batch**:
    -   Triggers `Modals.showDeleteBatchModal`.
- [ ] **Delete Playlist**:
    -   Triggers `Modals.showDeletePlaylistModal`.
    -   Removes single item from UI.
- [ ] **View Playlist Details**:
    -   Triggers local `playlistModal` (HTML hardcoded in View currently).
    -   Renders track list (Scrollable).

## 5. Security Strategy: SafeRender Foundation (New Phase 3)
*Goal: Fix the root cause of XSS risk before spreading components.*

### The Problem
Current components (`Card.js`, `TrackRow.js`) use `innerHTML` with template literals. While `escapeHtml` is used, it relies on developer discipline and is prone to regressions.

### The Solution: `SafeRender` Utility
A lightweight wrapper around `document.createElement` to allow declarative DOM construction without innerHTML.

```javascript
// Before (Risk of XSS if sanitize missed)
el.innerHTML = `<div class="title">${title}</div>`

// After (Safe by default)
const el = SafeDOM.create('div', { className: 'title' }, title)
```

## 6. Execution Plan using SDD

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Completed)
- [x] Create Directory Structure
- [x] Create `Card.js` (Alpha)
- [x] Create `TrackRow.js` (Alpha)
- [x] Create `BaseModal.js` (Alpha)

### Phase 2: Pilot Refactor (Completed)
- [x] Refactor `SavedPlaylistsView`
- [x] Fix Edit Batch Bugs (#98, #99)

### Phase 3: SafeRender Foundation (NEW PRIORITY)

    - Fluent API for element creation.
    - Automatic `textContent` for string children.
    - Event listener attachment.
- [x] **Upgrade Core Components**:
    - Refactor `Card.js` to use `SafeDOM`.
    - Refactor `TrackRow.js` to use `SafeDOM`.
    - Refactor `BaseModal.js` to use `SafeDOM`.
- [x] **Verify**: Ensure `SavedPlaylistsView` (Pilot) works with upgraded components.

### Phase 4: Holistic Migration (The "Safe" Grind)
*Now safe to copy-paste everywhere.*
- [x] **Migrate Rankings**: Refactor to `TrackRow` (Safe).
- [x] **Migrate Inventory**: Refactor to `Card` (Safe).
- [x] **Migrate Albums Grid**: Refactor to `Card` (Safe).

### Phase 5: Cleanup & Final Hardening
- [x] Delete legacy folders.
- [x] Global search for residual `innerHTML` (Goal: 0 matches).

## 7. Success Metrics (Definition of Done)

### A. Outputs (Entregáveis Tangíveis)
- **SafeDOM Utility**: `public/js/utils/SafeDOM.js` implemented.
- **Unified Component Library**: `src/components/ui/` populated.
- **Secure Components**: All `src/components/ui/` components free of `innerHTML`.
- **Legacy Extinction**: ALL legacy views migrated to secure components.
- **Refactored Views**: `SavedPlaylistsView.js` rewritten using new components.
- **Cleaned Codebase**: Deletion of `components/base`, `components/shared`, `components/common`.
- **Security Patches**: 53 files patched to replace `innerHTML`.

### B. Outcomes (Resultados de Negócio)

#### Quantitative
- **Reusability Score**: Target **> 40%** (Current: 5.5%).
- **SavedPlaylistsView Size**: Target **< 300 LOC** (Current: 626 LOC).
- **Security Sinks**: Target **0** (Current: 53).
- **Duplication**: **0** instances of manual `track-row` HTML construction.

#### Qualitative
- **Security**: 0 XSS Vectors (innerHTML).
- **Visual Consistency**: Changing `Card.js` updates Home, Search, and Series instantly.
- **Developer Experience**: "Assembly" vs "Construction". Devs compose UI instead of writing HTML strings.
- **Security Posture**: "Zero Tolerance" policy enforcement prevents future regressions.
- **Performance**: Faster rendering (direct DOM nodes vs parser).

    - [x] "Critic's Choice" -> "Top 3 Acclaimed Tracks on BestEverAlbums"
    - [x] "Greatest Hits" -> "Top 5 Tracks by Spotify Popularity"
    - [x] "Deep Cuts" -> "Top 5 Acclaimed Tracks on BestEverAlbums"
    - [x] "MJRP Balanced Cascade" -> "MJRP Zé's Full Balanced Playlists"

- [x] **Reorder "Pick Ingredients" (New Order)**:
    - [x] **1st**: **Grouping Tracks** (New Param) - Defines the "Shape" of the result.
    - [x] **2nd**: **Output Mode** (Single Playlist vs Series)
    - [x] **3rd**: **Target Duration** (Conditional Visibility)

- [x] **Conditional Logic for Target Duration**:
    - [x] **HIDE** if Algorithm is "Fixed Count" (e.g., Top 3, Top 5).
    - [x] **SHOW** when "Multiple Playlists" output mode is selected.

- [x] **Flavor Grouping**:
    - [x] Group Spotify-based algorithms together
    - [x] Group BEA-based algorithms together

## Phase 3: Algorithm Parameterization (New "Grouping Tracks" Param) ✅

- [x] **Define Strategies**:
    1.  **By Album**: Preserves Album integrity. e.g. [Alb A: 1,2,3] -> [Alb B: 1,2,3].
    2.  **Global Rank (Interleaved)**: Best of everything mixed. e.g. [Alb A #1, Alb B #1, Alb A #2, Alb B #2...].
    3.  **Artist Cluster**: Best of Artist X, then Best of Artist Y. e.g. [Art X: 1s], [Art Y: 1s]...
    4.  **Shuffle**: Random mix.

- [x] **Implementation**:
    - [x] Update `TopNAlgorithm.generate()` to accept `groupingStrategy`.
    - [x] Implement `_applyGrouping()` method for sorting logic.
    - [x] Changed distribution from round-robin to sequential (preserves grouping).

## Phase 4: Critical Hotfixes (Prod Polish) ✅

- [x] **Badge Rename**: "Acclaim" -> "BestEverAlbums" (Card.js, SeriesToolbar.js, TracksTabs.js, TracksTable.js).
- [x] **Cover Art Fix**: `BlendSeriesSelector.js` thumbnail loading logic with fallbacks.

## 📋 Your Tasks

## 📋 Your Tasks

### Task 1: [DEPRECATED] Album Type Filter
*Removed from scope per User Feedback (2025-12-17)* - Filtering will be handled during search/loading in HomeView, not post-load in AlbumsView.

### Task 2: Artist Search Enhancement (Priority 1)

**Goal**: Ensure artist search works with ANY Apple Music artist

**Current State**: Artist autocomplete in HomeView uses Apple Music API

**Verify**:
1. Search for obscure artists (not just mainstream)
2. Check `MusicKitService.getArtistAlbums()` has no BestEver filtering
3. Add artist avatar/image to search results if not present

**Verify**:
1. Search for obscure artists (not just mainstream)
2. Check `MusicKitService.getArtistAlbums()` has no BestEver filtering
3. Add artist avatar/image to search results if not present

### Task 3: Rankings Editor UI (Stretch Goal)

**Goal**: UI to view/edit track rankings per album

**Location**: New modal or section in album detail view

**Data Model** (Firestore):
```javascript
// In album document
{
  rankings: {
    "track-1": { rank: 1, source: "bestever" | "musicboard" | "user" },
    "track-2": { rank: 2, source: "user" }
  }
}
```

---

## ⚠️ Coordination Rules

1. **Branch**: Work on `feature/sprint9-ranking-enrichment`
2. **No Overlap**: Only edit files in `public/js/` folder
3. **Don't Touch**: `server/` folder (Agent A is working there)
4. **Commits**: Use conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
5. **Test Before Commit**: Run `npm run build` to verify

---

## 🔍 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Verify you're on correct branch
git checkout feature/sprint9-ranking-enrichment
git pull origin feature/sprint9-ranking-enrichment

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build to verify no errors
npm run build

# View the app
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **UI Style**: Follow existing patterns - glass panels, neon accents
2. **Toast Messages**: Use `import toast from '../components/Toast.js'`
3. **Icons**: Use `import { getIcon } from '../components/Icons.js'`
4. **Store Updates**: Call `store.notify()` after state changes

# Bug Specification Review - Issues #54, #55

**Updated**: 2025-12-18 16:14  
**Status**: ✅ Decisões tomadas - Aguardando última confirmação

---

## Decisões Confirmadas

| Pergunta | Decisão |
|----------|---------|
| **Arquitetura** | Opção A - Views Separadas |
| **Regenerate EDIT** | Permitir |
| **Carregar dados EDIT** | ❓ Aguardando |

---

## Análise: Regenerate no EDIT Mode

### O Problema dos IDs

```
Estado inicial:               Após Regenerate:
─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────
playlist.id = "abc123"       │ playlist.id = "xyz789" (NOVO)
playlist.batchName = "V1"    │ playlist.batchName = "V1" (mantido)
```

Quando você regenera, o algoritmo cria **playlists novas com IDs novos**.

Se o Save usa `playlist.id` para upsert no Firestore → cria **documentos novos** (bug #54)

### Solução Proposta

Na EditPlaylistView, o Save sempre:
1. Deleta TODOS os documentos onde `batchName === currentBatchName`
2. Salva as novas playlists com o mesmo `batchName`

Assim não importa se os IDs mudaram - o `batchName` é o identificador real.

> **Seu comentário sobre Regenerate**:

## Análise: Firestore vs localStorage

| Aspecto | Firestore (fresh) | localStorage |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Dados** | Sempre corretos | Pode estar stale |
| **Performance** | ~500ms latência | Instantâneo |
| **Offline** | Não funciona | Funciona |
| **Conflitos** | Evita | Pode ter dados antigos |
| **Bug #55** | ✅ Resolve | ❌ Causa o problema |

### Minha Recomendação: Firestore

O bug #55 (Ghost Playlists) é **exatamente** causado por localStorage trazendo dados antigos.

Se EditPlaylistView carregar sempre do Firestore:
- Dados sempre corretos
- Sem contaminação de outras sessões
- Trade-off de 500ms é aceitável para garantir integridade

> **Seu comentário sobre Firestore vs localStorage**:

---

## Implementação Proposta

### CreatePlaylistView (nova ou renomear atual)

- **Rota**: `/playlists` ou `/playlists?create=true`
- **Mount**: `playlistsStore.clear()` - sempre começa vazio
- **Regenerate**: Permitido, ilimitado
- **Save**: Sempre cria batch NOVO

### EditPlaylistView (nova)

- **Rota**: `/playlists?edit=batchName`
- **Mount**: Carregar do Firestore por batchName (não localStorage)
- **Regenerate**: Permitido (IDs mudam, batchName mantido)
- **Save**: Deleta batch antigo → Salva novo com mesmo batchName

> **Seu comentário sobre a implementação**:

---

## Próximos Passos (após sua confirmação)

1. Criar `EditPlaylistView.js`
2. Modificar router para distinguir as rotas
3. Modificar `SavedPlaylistsView` para usar nova rota de edit
4. Testar fluxos CREATE e EDIT separadamente

# Musicboard Scraper - Onboarding Document

**Created**: 2025-12-17 17:51
**Status**: 🚧 In Progress (needs debugging)
**Assignee**: Agent B

---

## 📋 Context

We need a scraper for https://musicboard.app to extract track ratings as a secondary source after BestEverAlbums.

### Why Puppeteer?
- Musicboard is a **React SPA** - the HTML comes empty (`<div id="root"></div>`)
- Data is loaded via JavaScript after page render
- Cannot use simple `axios + cheerio` like BestEverAlbums

---

## 📁 Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `server/lib/scrapers/musicboard.js` | Main scraper (~400 lines) |
| `server/scripts/testMusicboardScraper.js` | Test script |
| `server/scripts/debugMusicboard.js` | Debug script (captures HTML/screenshot) |

---

## 🐛 Current Issue

**Problem**: Scraper runs but extracts 0 tracks

```
[Musicboard] Navigating to https://musicboard.app/album/metallica-metallica/
[Musicboard] Track selector not found, trying alternative selectors
[Musicboard] Extracted 0 tracks
```

**Root Cause**: Generic CSS selectors are not matching Musicboard's actual DOM structure.

### What's Needed

1. **Run debug script** to capture actual page HTML:
   ```bash
   cd server && node scripts/debugMusicboard.js
   ```

2. **Analyze** `server/scripts/musicboard-debug.html` to find correct selectors

3. **Update** `extractTrackRatings()` in `musicboard.js` with correct selectors

---

## 📖 Reference: BestEver Scraper

See `server/lib/scrapers/besteveralbums.js` for pattern:
- Uses `axios + cheerio` (simpler because server-rendered)
- Returns format:
  ```javascript
  {
    provider: 'BestEverAlbums',
    providerType: 'community',
    referenceUrl: '...',
    evidence: [
      { trackTitle: 'Enter Sandman', rating: 94, position: 1 },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

---

## 🎯 Expected Output Format

Same structure as BestEver:

```javascript
{
  provider: 'Musicboard',
  providerType: 'community',
  referenceUrl: 'https://musicboard.app/album/...',
  evidence: [
    { trackTitle: 'Enter Sandman', rating: 4.2, position: 1 },
    { trackTitle: 'Sad But True', rating: 4.1, position: 2 },
    // Musicboard uses 0-10 scale (not 0-100 like BestEver)
  ]
}
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Puppeteer v24 Changes
- `page.waitForTimeout()` is **DEPRECATED** ❌
- Use `delay()` helper instead (already added)

### Memory Issue
- Puppeteer tests were timing out due to Mac memory constraints
- Consider running with `--disable-dev-shm-usage` flag (already in config)

### URL Pattern
```
https://musicboard.app/album/{artist-slug}-{album-slug}/
Example: https://musicboard.app/album/metallica-metallica/
```

---

## ✅ Tasks

- [x] Create `musicboard.js` scraper skeleton
- [x] Add caching layer (1 hour TTL)
- [x] Create test script
- [x] Fix deprecated `waitForTimeout`
- [ ] **Debug actual DOM structure** (Run debugMusicboard.js)
- [ ] **Update CSS selectors** in `extractTrackRatings()`
- [ ] Verify with test albums (Metallica, Pink Floyd)
- [ ] Integrate with `fetchRanking.js` as secondary source

---

## 📌 Test Commands

```bash
# Run debug (captures HTML)
cd server && node scripts/debugMusicboard.js

# Run test scraper
cd server && node scripts/testMusicboardScraper.js
```

---

## 🔗 Integration Point

After scraper works, integrate in `server/lib/fetchRanking.js`:

```javascript
// After BestEver scraping, try Musicboard as fallback
if (!result || result.evidence.length === 0) {
  const musicboard = require('./scrapers/musicboard')
  result = await musicboard.getRankingForAlbum(title, artist)
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Circular imports | Use index.js barrel exports per module directory |
| `this` context loss | Pass `view` reference to module functions |
| Event listener leaks | Ensure `destroy()` calls module cleanup |
| Build size increase | Monitor via `npm run build -- --report` |

---

## Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Duration | Checkpoint |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Phase 0 | 15 min | Build passes |
| Phase 1 | 2-3 hours | All Albums features work |
| Phase 2 | 1-2 hours | All API endpoints work |
| Phase 3 | 1-2 hours | Playlists features work |

**Total**: ~5-7 hours of focused work

# Rankings System Architecture

**Created**: 2025-12-17
**Sprint**: 9 - Rankings Refactor & Data Enrichment

---

## 📊 Overview

The Rankings System consolidates track rankings from multiple sources to determine the order of tracks in playlists.

    F --> G[Ordered Track List]
    
    H[Musicboard Scraper] -.->|Sprint 9| B
    I[User Rankings] -.->|Future| B
```

---

## 🏗️ Core Components

### 1. `server/lib/fetchRanking.js`

**Purpose**: Orchestrates ranking data fetching from multiple sources.

**Current Flow**:
1. Try BestEver scraper
2. If incomplete → AI enrichment (Gemini)
3. Merge results with album tracks

**Integration Points** (for Musicboard):
- Line 53-77: BestEver scraper block
- After BestEver, before AI enrichment

### 2. `server/lib/ranking.js`

**Purpose**: Consolidates rankings using Borda count algorithm.

**Key Function**: `consolidateRanking(tracks, acclaim)`
- `tracks`: Official album tracklist
- `acclaim`: Array of `{ provider, trackTitle, position, rating, referenceUrl }`

**Algorithm**:
- Borda points: `N - position + 1` (where N = total tracks)
- Rating priority: BestEver > Other sources
- Fuzzy matching: Token overlap >= 0.4

### 3. `server/lib/scrapers/besteveralbums.js`

**Purpose**: Scrape track ratings from BestEverAlbums.com

**Output Format**:
```javascript
{
  provider: 'BestEverAlbums',
  providerType: 'community',
  referenceUrl: 'https://...',
  evidence: [
    { trackTitle: 'Enter Sandman', rating: 94 },
    { trackTitle: 'Sad But True', rating: 91 }
  ]
}
```

### 4. `server/lib/scrapers/musicboard.js` (In Progress)

**Purpose**: Scrape track ratings from musicboard.app

**Status**: Skeleton created, needs DOM selector debugging

---

## 📈 Rating Scales

| Source | Scale | Normalization |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| BestEverAlbums | 0-100 | Use directly |
| Musicboard | 0-10 | Multiply by 10 |
| User Rankings | 1-N (position) | Convert to Borda points |

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Input: Album Request
```javascript
{
  title: "Metallica",
  artist: "Metallica",
  tracks: [
    { title: "Enter Sandman", duration: 331 },
    { title: "Sad But True", duration: 324 },
    // ...
  ]
}
```

### Output: Ranked Entries
```javascript
{
  entries: [
    { trackTitle: "Enter Sandman", position: 1, rating: 94, provider: "BestEverAlbums" },
    { trackTitle: "Sad But True", position: 2, rating: 91, provider: "BestEverAlbums" }
  ],
  sources: [
    { provider: "BestEverAlbums", providerType: "community", referenceUrl: "..." }
  ]
}
```

---

## 🎯 Source Priority (Sprint 9 Decision)

```
1. BestEverAlbums (primary - most complete data)
   ↓
2. Musicboard (secondary - when BestEver incomplete)
   ↓
3. User Rankings (future - manual override capability)
   ↓
4. AI Enrichment (fallback - when scrapers fail)
```

---

## 📝 Sprint 9 Changes Planned

### fetchRanking.js Modifications

```javascript
// BEFORE (current): Only BestEver
const best = await getBestEverRanking(title, artist)

// AFTER (Sprint 9): BestEver + Musicboard fallback
const best = await getBestEverRanking(title, artist)
if (!best || best.evidence?.length < minTracks) {
  const musicboard = await getMusicboardRanking(title, artist)
  // Merge sources, normalize ratings (Musicboard 0-10 → 0-100)
}
```

### Rating Normalization Helper

```javascript
function normalizeRating(rating, source) {
  if (source === 'Musicboard') {
    return rating * 10 // 0-10 → 0-100
  }
  return rating // BestEver already 0-100
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Considerations

1. **Multi-source consolidation**: Both BestEver + Musicboard evidence
2. **Rating normalization**: 0-10 → 0-100 conversion
3. **Fallback behavior**: Musicboard only when BestEver incomplete
4. **Fuzzy matching**: Track title variations across sources

# Feature Specification: Sprint 10 - Codebase Refactoring

**Feature Branch**: `sprint10-refactor`  
**Created**: 2025-12-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Code Quality Assessment from `docs/refactor/CODE_QUALITY_ASSESSMENT.md`

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Developer Navigates AlbumsView (Priority: P1)

A developer needs to understand and modify the Albums view behavior. Currently, the 1,820-line monolithic file makes it extremely difficult to locate specific functionality, leading to longer development time and higher bug risk.

**Why this priority**: AlbumsView.js is the largest file (72KB) and most frequently modified. Every sprint touches this file, creating merge conflicts and regression risks. Modularizing it will accelerate all future development.

**Independent Test**: After refactoring, a developer should be able to find the grid rendering logic in under 30 seconds by navigating to `views/albums/AlbumsGridRenderer.js`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer looking for filter logic, **When** they search for "filterAlbums", **Then** they find it isolated in `AlbumsFilters.js` with clear single responsibility.
2. **Given** AlbumsView.js after refactor, **When** measuring lines of code, **Then** the main file has < 600 lines.
3. **Given** the Albums page in browser, **When** user interacts with all features (filter, search, view toggle, series modal), **Then** all functionality works identical to before refactor.

---

### User Story 2 - Faster Server Endpoint Discovery (Priority: P2)

A developer needs to find or add an API endpoint. Currently, 535 lines in `server/index.js` with 7 endpoints mixed together makes navigation slow and error-prone.

**Why this priority**: Backend changes are less frequent than frontend but critical for API stability. Route separation improves testability and deployment confidence.

**Independent Test**: After refactoring, each route file (`routes/albums.js`, `routes/playlists.js`, `routes/debug.js`) can be tested independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** server/index.js after refactor, **When** measuring lines of code, **Then** the main file has < 150 lines.
2. **Given** a request to `/api/generate`, **When** server handles it, **Then** response is identical to before refactor.
3. **Given** a request to `/api/enrich-album`, **When** server handles it, **Then** response includes `bestEverInfo.albumId` correctly.

---

### User Story 3 - Clean PlaylistsView for Export Features (Priority: P3)

A developer needs to modify Apple Music export. Currently, export logic is intertwined with drag-and-drop and generation logic in a 891-line file.

**Why this priority**: Export is a critical user-facing feature. Isolating it reduces regression risk when modifying drag-and-drop or generation.

**Independent Test**: After refactoring, `PlaylistsExport.js` can be unit tested for Apple Music export without loading the entire PlaylistsView.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** PlaylistsView.js after refactor, **When** measuring lines of code, **Then** the main file has < 500 lines.
2. **Given** user exports playlist to Apple Music, **When** export completes, **Then** behavior is identical to before refactor.

---

### User Story 4 - Remove Dead Legacy Code (Priority: P1)

The codebase contains `app.legacy.js` (47KB), a dead monolith that is never imported but adds confusion and bloat.

**Why this priority**: Zero-risk deletion that immediately improves codebase cleanliness and reduces confusion for new developers.

**Independent Test**: After deletion, run `npm run build` and all tests - everything should pass with no references to deleted file.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** `app.legacy.js` deleted, **When** running `npm run build`, **Then** build succeeds with no errors.
2. **Given** `app.legacy.js` deleted, **When** running `npm run test`, **Then** all tests pass.
3. **Given** `app.legacy.js` deleted, **When** loading app in browser, **Then** all features work normally.

---

## Edge Cases

- What happens if a module import path is incorrect after refactoring?
  - Build will fail immediately, verifiable via `npm run build`
- How does system handle circular dependencies if they're introduced?
  - Vite bundler will warn/error during build
- What if a refactored module has missing exports?
  - Runtime error will occur on first usage, detectable via manual testing

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain all existing functionality after refactoring
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain < 1 second page load time after refactoring
- **FR-003**: Build process MUST complete successfully with `npm run build`
- **FR-004**: All existing tests MUST pass after refactoring
- **FR-005**: No new dependencies MUST be added for refactoring

### Key Entities

- **AlbumsView**: Main view orchestrator (post-refactor: delegation only)
- **AlbumsGridRenderer**: Rendering logic for grid/list modes
- **AlbumsFilters**: Filter state and logic
- **SeriesModals**: Modal handling for series CRUD
- **AlbumsDataLoader**: Album fetching and caching orchestration

---

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: AlbumsView.js < 600 lines (from 1,820)
- **SC-002**: server/index.js < 150 lines (from 535)
- **SC-003**: PlaylistsView.js < 500 lines (from 891)
- **SC-004**: app.legacy.js deleted (47KB savings)
- **SC-005**: All 39 existing tests pass after refactor
- **SC-006**: No visual or functional regression in UI
- **SC-007**: Build time unchanged (+/- 5%)

# Sprint 9 Planning: Rankings & Artist/Album Enrichment

## 📋 Overview

Sprint 9 focuses on two main areas:
1. **Rankings Integration** - Using track rankings in the playlist algorithms
2. **Artist/Album Enrichment** - Live search via Apple Music API vs internal batch

---

## 🔍 Analysis: Apple Music API Integration

### Current State
- **MusicKitService.js** already has:
  - `getArtistAlbums(artistName)` - Fetches discography from Apple Music
  - `searchAlbums(artist, album)` - Searches catalog
  - Rate: **20 requests/second** per user (generous)

### Question: Internal Batch vs Apple API Direct?

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Internal Batch** | Faster (local), No API limits, Works offline | Limited catalog, Manual updates |
| **Apple API Direct** | Complete catalog, Always current, No maintenance | Requires auth, Latency (~200-500ms), Rate limits |
| **Hybrid** | Best of both, Cache popular artists | More complexity |

### Recommendation: **Hybrid Approach**

1. **Artist Filter Dropdown**: 
   - Type-ahead uses Apple API (`getArtistAlbums`)
   - Results cached in memory for session
   - Performance: ~300ms for first search, instant thereafter

2. **Album Select**:
   - Already uses Apple API via `searchAlbums`
   - Performance acceptable (200-500ms)

3. **Fallback**:
   - If API fails, show "Bulk Mode" text input
   - Previously loaded artists remain in dropdown

### Performance Considerations

```
Apple Music API:
- First request: 200-500ms (cold)
- Subsequent: <200ms (likely cached by Apple CDN)
- Rate limit: 20 req/s = very generous
- Pagination: Up to 100 albums per request
```

**Verdict: API Direct is VIABLE** with proper caching strategy.

---

## 📊 Rankings System Analysis

### Current Implementation
- **consolidateRanking()** in `server/lib/ranking.js` uses Borda count
- **RankingView.js** displays ranked vs original tracklist
- Rankings come from external acclaim sources

### Sprint 9 Goals for Rankings
1. **UI to view/edit track rankings** per album
2. **Algorithm uses rankings** to prioritize tracks in playlists
3. **Manual override** capability for user preferences

---

## 🎯 Proposed Sprint 9 Scope

### Phase 1: Artist/Album Enrichment (Apple API Live)
- [ ] Add artist search autocomplete with Apple API
- [ ] Cache artist discographies in session
- [ ] Loading states and error handling
- [ ] Fallback to bulk mode on API failure

### Phase 2: Rankings Integration
- [ ] Rankings editor in album detail view
- [ ] Store rankings in Firestore per album
- [ ] Algorithm pulls rankings when generating playlists
- [ ] Visual indicator in playlist tracks (rank badge)

### Phase 3: UI Polish
- [ ] Artist dropdown with avatar/images
- [ ] Album cards with release year badges
- [ ] Ranking badges in track lists

---

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation Notes

### Artist Autocomplete Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>HomeView: Type "Portis"
    HomeView->>MusicKitService: getArtistSuggestions("Portis")
    MusicKitService->>Apple API: /v1/catalog/{storefront}/search?types=artists
    Apple API-->>MusicKitService: Artists list
    MusicKitService-->>HomeView: [{name, id, artwork}...]
    HomeView->>User: Show dropdown
    User->>HomeView: Select "Portishead"
    HomeView->>MusicKitService: getArtistAlbums(artistId)
    MusicKitService-->>HomeView: Discography grid
```

### Rankings Data Model
```javascript
// Per album in Firestore
{
  albumId: "...",
  rankings: {
    "track-1": { rank: 1, source: "user" | "acclaim" | "bestever" },
    "track-2": { rank: 2, source: "acclaim" }
  },
  lastUpdated: "2024-12-16T..."
}
```

---

## ✅ Decisions Made (User Feedback 2025-12-17)

### 1. Rankings Source Priority
**Decision**: **BestEver > Musicboard (scraper) > User Rankings**

- BestEver album rankings are primary source
- Musicboard (https://musicboard.app/) is secondary - requires scraper investigation (future sprint)
- User-generated rankings: prepare architecture for future sprint implementation

### 2. Artist Search Scope
**Decision**: **Any Apple Music artist allowed**

- No limitation to BestEver-only artists
- Full Apple Music catalog available for artist/album selection
- This is the goal: open to all artists!

### 3. Album Filter by Type
**Decision**: **[REVISED] Filter logic belongs in Search/Loading phase**

- *Correction (2025-12-17)*: Users clarified that filtering should happen when searching/loading albums in `HomeView`, not as a post-load filter in `AlbumsView`.
- **Action**: Removed Task 1 from Agent B scope (AlbumsView modification).
- **Future**: Consider adding "Type" toggle in HomeView search results.

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. ~~Investigate Apple Music API for album type metadata~~ [DONE - API has type info]
2. Design Musicboard scraper architecture (for future sprint)
3. ~~Implement artist search with full Apple Music catalog~~ [DONE]
4. **[BACKLOG]** Refactor HomeView to extract ArtistDiscographyPanel component before adding Type Filter (Issue #56)

## 🎯 Recommended Approach: Context Object Pattern

Para resolver o bloqueio de `this` context nos módulos:

```javascript
// Módulo
export function setupSeriesModals(context) {
  const { container, editingSeriesId, showToast, update } = context
  // Use context instead of this
}

// View
import { setupSeriesModals } from './albums/SeriesModals.js'
setupSeriesModals({
  container: this.container,
  editingSeriesId: () => this.editingSeriesId,
  showToast: (msg, type) => Toast.show(msg, type),
  update: () => this.update()
})
```

---

## 🧹 Cleanup Tasks

| Task | File | Size | Priority |
|------|------|------|----------|
| DELETE | `server/lib/scrapers/musicboard.js` | 352 lines | Medium |
| UPDATE | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | - | Low |
| UPDATE | `CODE_QUALITY_ASSESSMENT.md` | - | Low |

# Plan: Ranking Strategy Selection

**Status**: DRAFT
**Sprint**: 11.5
**Depends On**: `AlgorithmStrategy` (Sprint 8)

---

## 1. Architecture: The Ranking Strategy Pattern

We will implement a Strategy Pattern to encapsulate "How tracks are ranked". This decouples the **Sorting Criteria** (Input) from the **Distribution Logic** (Output Algorithm like Cascade).

### Class Hierarchy
**Location**: `public/js/ranking/`

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class RankingStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        +id: string
        +name: string
        +description: string
        +rank(tracks: Track[]): Track[]
        +getEffectiveRating(track: Track): number
    }

    class BalancedRankingStrategy {
        +rank(tracks)
        note: "Acclaim Priority > Rating > Score (Current Hybrid)"
    }

    class SpotifyRankingStrategy {
        +rank(tracks)
        note: "Spotify Popul. > Rating > Acclaim"
    }

    class BEARankingStrategy {
        +rank(tracks)
        note: "Rating (User) > Acclaim > Spotify"
    }

    RankingStrategy <|-- BalancedRankingStrategy
    RankingStrategy <|-- SpotifyRankingStrategy
    RankingStrategy <|-- BEARankingStrategy
```

### Data Flow
1.  **UI**: User selects Ranking Strategy (e.g., "Spotify Priority").
2.  **Controller**: `AlbumsStateController` or `PlaylistsView` captures preference.
3.  **Generation**: 
    - `BaseAlgorithm.generate(albums, { rankingStrategy: 'spotify' })` called.
    - Inside Algorithm:
      - `StrategyFactory.get('spotify').rank(album.tracks)` is called *before* any distribution logic.
      - Tracks are returned with `_rank` property (1 to N) based on that strategy.
    - Algorithm distributes tracks based on `_rank`.

---

## 2. Key Strategies Logic

| Strategy | Primary Key | Secondary Key | Fallback | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Balanced** (Default) | `acclaimRank` (Explicit) | `rating` (Hybrid) | `score` | Best for "Canon" lists. Uses BEA data heavily. |
| **Spotify** | `spotifyPopularity` | `rating` | `acclaimRank` | Best for "Modern" listeners. Popular tracks get S-Tier. |
| **BEA Rating** | `rating` (User/Avg) | `acclaimRank` | `spotifyPopularity` | Best for "Quality" lists. Highest rated tracks first. |

---

## 3. UI/UX Design

**File**: `public/js/views/PlaylistsView.js`

We will add a new dropdown selector next to the Algorithm Selector.

### Mockup
```

│   * Acclaim > Rating > Pop         * Balanced Deep Cuts     │
│                                                             │
│  [ Generate Playlists ]                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Strategy Selector Options
*   `🌿 Balanced` (Default)
*   `🎧 Spotify Popularity`
*   `⭐ BEA Rating`

---

### 3. Algorithm Adaptation (Integration Point) (Updated)

**Target Algorithm**: `MJRPBalancedCascadeAlgorithm.js`

We will **remove** the dependency on `LegacyRoundRobinAlgorithm`.

**Current Code**:
```javascript
this._legacyHelper = new LegacyRoundRobinAlgorithm(opts)
// ...
tracks: this._legacyHelper.enrichTracks(album)
```

**New Code**:
```javascript
generate(albums, opts = {}) {
    // 1. Get Strategy (Default to Balanced if not provided)
    const strategy = opts.rankingStrategy || new BalancedRankingStrategy();
    
    // 2. Rank Tracks (Input Adaptation)
    // The Strategy returns tracks with a standardized `_rank` property (1..N)
    const workingAlbums = albums.map(album => {
        const rankedTracks = strategy.rank(album);
        return { ...album, tracks: rankedTracks };
    });
    
    // 3. Distribution (Existing Logic)
    // The algorithm now uses `track._rank` which was populated by the Strategy.
    // ...
}
```

---

## 4. Implementation Steps

1.  **Scaffold**: Create `public/js/ranking/` and base `RankingStrategy.js`.
2.  **Strategies Implementation**:
    *   **Balanced**: COPY logic from Legacy (do not touch Legacy file) to ensure `LegacyRoundRobin` remains frozen/safe.
    *   **Spotify & BEA**: Implement new logic.
3.  **Refactor Algorithm**: 
    *   Update `MJRPBalancedCascadeAlgorithm` to accept `opts.rankingStrategy`.
    *   Remove `this._legacyHelper`.
    *   Use `strategy.rank(album)` to prepare tracks.
4.  **UI**: Update `PlaylistsView.js` to pass the selected strategy instance (or ID) to the generator.

---

## 5. Risk Assessment

*   **Risk**: Logic Drift between Legacy and Balanced Strategy.
    *   *Mitigation*: We accept this. Legacy is "frozen". Balanced Strategy becomes the new standard for modern algorithms.
*   **Risk**: Missing Data for specific strategies.
    *   *Mitigation*: Strategies must always return *some* list. Fallbacks are internal to the Strategy (e.g., SpotifyStrategy falls back to Rating if no popularity).


## User Review Required
**Does this plan align with your vision?** 
*   Separation of "Ranking Source" vs. "Algorithm".
*   The UI placement.
*   The 3 proposed strategies.

# Specification: Ranking Strategy Selection

**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
**Sprint**: 11.5 - Stabilization & Refactor
**Authors**: Antigravity

---

## 1. Problem Statement
Currently, playlist generation algorithms (like `MJRPBalancedCascadeAlgorithm`) are tightly coupled with a single, hardcoded ranking logic (found in `LegacyRoundRobinAlgorithm.enrichTracks`). This makes it impossible for users to choose alternative "Sources of Truth" for ranking, such as strictly using Spotify Popularity or strictly BestEverAlbums (BEA) ratings.

## 2. Objective
Implement a **Ranking Strategy Pattern** that decouples the sorting/ranking of tracks (Input Selection) from the distribution/balancing logic (Algorithm execution). This allows the system to be extensible for new ranking sources and gives users control over how their playlists are prioritized.

## 3. Success Criteria
- [ ] **Decoupling**: Algorithms receive a list of "ranked" tracks without knowing *how* they were ranked.
- [ ] **Extensibility**: Adding a new ranking source (e.g., Last.fm scrobbles) should only require a new strategy class.
- [ ] **User Control**: The UI allows selecting a ranking preference (Balanced, Spotify, BEA) before generating playlists.
- [ ] **Algorithm Compatibility**: The ranking selection dynamically enables/disables compatible algorithms if necessary (per user feedback).

## 4. Requirement Overview
- A common interface for all Ranking Strategies.
- At least three initial strategies:
    1. **Balanced** (Current hybrid: Acclaim Rank > Rating > Score).
    2. **Spotify Priority** (Spotify Popularity as primary metric).
    3. **BEA Priority** (BestEverAlbums Rating/Rank as primary metric).
- UI integration in the Playlist Generation view.

## 5. Scope
- **In-Scope**:
    - Creation of the `RankingStrategy` architecture.
    - Implementation of the 3 strategies mentioned.
    - Modification of Algorithm inputs to accept these strategies.
    - UI Selectors in `PlaylistsView`.
- **Out-of-Scope**:
    - Scraping new data sources (we use existing enriched data).
    - Changing the core balancing logic of Cascading/Serpentine.

---

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Key Decision**: As per your feedback, choosing a ranking source should be the "gatekeeper" or the first step that determines which algorithms are available or how they behave. 

**Does this specification accurately capture the "WHAT" and "WHY" of the ranking strategy refactor?**

### Album Loading Pipeline (Edit Mode)

```mermaid

    A[Edit Mode Entry] --> B{Albums Cached?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Use Cached]
    B -->|No| D[Get albumQueries from Series]

    E --> F[Backend /api/generate]
    F --> G[AI + BestEver Scraper]
    G --> H[albumsStore.addAlbumToSeries]
```

### Key Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Thin Orchestrator** | PlaylistsView reduced from 960 to ~300 LOC |
| **Controller Decoupling** | PlaylistsController has 0 DOM references |
| **Service Layer** | PlaylistGenerationService, PlaylistPersistenceService |
| **Atomic Saves** | WriteBatch for transactional playlist saves |

### Mode Detection

| Entry Point | Mode | Data Source |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| `/playlists` | CREATE | In-memory generation |
| `/playlists/edit?edit=X&seriesId=Y` | EDIT | Firestore → API reload |

    View->>Controller: deleteTrack(playlistIndex, trackIndex)
    Controller->>Store: removeTrack(playlistIndex, trackIndex)
    Store->>Store: splice(trackIndex, 1)
    Store-->>View: notify()
    View->>View: update() -> Re-render Grid

| **Deterministic Keys** | `normalizeKey()` → `artist-album` without special chars |
| **Lazy Cleanup** | `get()` checks `albumExistsCheck()` → deletes orphans |
| **TTL Validation** | Data expires after 30 days (`MAX_AGE_MS`) |
| **Schema Versioning** | `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1` → auto-invalidate on schema change |

## View Lifecycle & Navigation

The application uses a custom client-side router built on the History API (`pushState`). Views follow a standard lifecycle managed by the router.

### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Router
    participant CurrentView
    participant NewView
    participant DOM
    
    User->>Router: navigate('/albums')
    Router->>Router: beforeNavigateHooks()
    Router->>CurrentView: destroy()
    CurrentView->>CurrentView: cleanup subscriptions
    
    Router->>NewView: viewFactory()
    Router->>NewView: render(params)
    NewView-->>Router: HTML string
    Router->>DOM: container.innerHTML = html
    
    Router->>NewView: mount(params)
    NewView->>NewView: setup event listeners
    NewView->>NewView: subscribe to stores
    
    Router->>Router: afterNavigateHooks()
```

### Lifecycle Methods (BaseView)

| Method | When Called | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `render(params)` | After factory, before DOM | Returns HTML string |
| `mount(params)` | After HTML injected | Setup listeners, subscriptions |
| `destroy()` | Before navigation away | Cleanup listeners, subscriptions |
| `update()` | On store notification | Re-render parts of UI |

### Navigation API

```javascript
import { router } from './router.js'

// Navigate with history push
router.navigate('/albums?seriesId=123')

// Force reload current route (same view)
await router.loadRoute(window.location.pathname)
```

### Link Handling

The router intercepts all `<a href="/...">` clicks on the page and uses `pushState` instead of full page reload.

```html
<!-- These are automatically intercepted -->
<a href="/albums">View Albums</a>
<a href="/inventory">Inventory</a>
```

## Scenario 1: Load Series (Normal Flow)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant HomeView
    participant AlbumSeriesStore
    participant AlbumsView
    participant API
    participant AlbumsStore
    
    User->>HomeView: Create/Resume Series
    HomeView->>AlbumSeriesStore: setActiveSeries(id)
    HomeView->>AlbumsView: navigate('/albums?seriesId=X')
    
    AlbumsView->>AlbumSeriesStore: getActiveSeries()
    AlbumSeriesStore-->>AlbumsView: {id, name, albumQueries}
    
    AlbumsView->>AlbumsView: loadAlbumsFromQueries()
    AlbumsView->>AlbumsStore: reset() ⚠️ CLEARS OLD DATA
    
    loop For each query
        AlbumsView->>API: fetchAlbum(query)
        API-->>AlbumsView: albumData
        AlbumsView->>AlbumsStore: addAlbum(albumData)
    end
    
    AlbumsStore-->>AlbumsView: notify subscribers
    AlbumsView->>AlbumsView: render albums
```

**Key Points:**
- ⚠️ `reset()` called ONLY in `loadAlbumsFromQueries()` before loading new series
- Data persists in store after loading
- All subsequent navigations use cached data

---


## Scenario 2: Navigate to Playlists & Generate (with Ranking Strategy)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant View as PlaylistsView
    participant Store as AlbumsStore
    participant RankingFactory as Ranking/Index
    participant Strategy as RankingStrategy
    participant Algorithm as MJRPBalancedCascade
    participant PStore as PlaylistsStore
    
    User->>View: Select "Spotify Ranking"
    User->>View: Click "Generate"
    
    View->>RankingFactory: createRankingStrategy('spotify')
    RankingFactory-->>View: strategyInstance
    
    View->>Store: getAlbums()
    Store-->>View: [albums]
    
    View->>Algorithm: generate(albums, { strategy })
    
    loop For each album
        Algorithm->>Strategy: rank(album)
        Strategy->>Strategy: Sort tracks by popular/rating
        Strategy-->>Algorithm: [rankedTracks]
    end
    
    Algorithm->>Algorithm: Distribute playlists
    Algorithm-->>View: { playlists }
    
    View->>PStore: setPlaylists(playlists)
```

## Scenario 3: Navigate to Album Ranking

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant AlbumsView
    participant Router
    participant RankingView
    participant AlbumsStore
    
    User->>AlbumsView: Click album card
    AlbumsView->>Router: navigate('/ranking/album-id')
    Router->>AlbumsView: destroy()
    
    Note over AlbumsView,AlbumsStore: ✅ NO reset() - Store persists!
    
    Router->>RankingView: mount()
    RankingView->>RankingView: render(params)
    RankingView->>AlbumsStore: getAlbums()
    AlbumsStore-->>RankingView: [albums] ✅ Data available
    
    RankingView->>RankingView: findAlbum(albumId)
    Note over RankingView: Album found in store!
    
    RankingView->>RankingView: render ranking view
```

---

## Scenario 4: Hard Refresh (Edge Case)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser
    participant AlbumsView
    participant AlbumSeriesStore
    participant Firestore
    participant API
    participant AlbumsStore
    
    Browser->>AlbumsView: F5 on '/albums?seriesId=X'
    Note over AlbumsStore: ⚠️ Store is EMPTY (in-memory)
    
    AlbumsView->>AlbumsView: mount(params)
    AlbumsView->>AlbumSeriesStore: getActiveSeries()
    AlbumSeriesStore-->>AlbumsView: null ⚠️ (also empty)
    
    AlbumsView->>AlbumsView: Check for seriesId in URL
    AlbumsView->>Firestore: loadFromFirestore()
    Firestore-->>AlbumSeriesStore: [series data]
    
    AlbumsView->>AlbumSeriesStore: setActiveSeries(urlSeriesId)
    AlbumSeriesStore-->>AlbumsView: {id, name, albumQueries}
    
    AlbumsView->>AlbumsView: loadAlbumsFromQueries()
    AlbumsView->>AlbumsStore: reset() ⚠️ (already empty)
    
    loop For each query
        AlbumsView->>API: fetchAlbum(query)
        API-->>AlbumsView: albumData
        AlbumsView->>AlbumsStore: addAlbum(albumData)
    end
    
    AlbumsView->>AlbumsView: render albums
```

---

## Store State Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Empty: App Start
    Empty --> Loading: loadAlbumsFromQueries()
    Loading --> Loaded: API calls complete
    
    Loaded --> Loading: Load Different Series
    Loaded --> Loaded: Navigate between Views ✅
    Loaded --> Empty: Hard Refresh (F5)
    
    note right of Loading
        reset() called here
        before fetching new data
    end note
    
    note right of Loaded
        Data persists during:
        - AlbumsView → PlaylistsView
        - AlbumsView → RankingView
        - PlaylistsView ↔ RankingView
    end note
```

---

## Data Flow Summary

### ✅ Store Resets (Clear Data)
1. **Loading New Series**: `loadAlbumsFromQueries()` calls `reset()` before fetching
2. **Hard Refresh**: Browser clears memory, store starts empty

### ✅ Store Persists (Keep Data)
1. **View Navigation**: AlbumsView → PlaylistsView → RankingView
2. **Back/Forward**: Browser history navigation
3. **View Lifecycle**: destroy() does NOT reset

### Current Implementation

| Event | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| AlbumsView.constructor() | ✅ No reset() |
| AlbumsView.destroy() | ✅ No reset() |
| loadAlbumsFromQueries() | ✅ reset() before fetch |
| Navigate to Playlists | ✅ Store has data |
| Navigate to Ranking | ✅ Store has data |
| Hard Refresh | ✅ Fallback to Firestore |

---

## Architecture Benefits

```
AlbumsView loads data ONCE
  → Store persists while series active
    → PlaylistsView reads store
    → RankingView reads store
      → ✅ No duplication
      → ✅ No race conditions
      → ✅ No ghost albums
```

---

## Playlist Data Model

### Firestore Schema

```
Firestore Path:
users/{userId}/albumSeries/{seriesId}/playlists/{playlistId}
```

### Playlist Document Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Firestore document ID (auto-generated) |
| `batchName` | string | Grupo de playlists (ex: "Greatest Hits") |
| `name` | string | Nome individual da playlist (ex: "DC1", "DC2") |
| `tracks` | array | Lista de tracks com title, artist, duration, rating |
| `order` | number | Ordem da playlist no batch (0, 1, 2...) |
| `createdAt` | timestamp | Data de criação |
| `savedAt` | timestamp | Data da última atualização |

### Conceito: Batch vs Playlist

```
Batch "Greatest Hits" (batchName)
├── Playlist id="abc", name="DC1", order=0
├── Playlist id="def", name="DC2", order=1
└── Playlist id="ghi", name="DC3", order=2
```

Um **batch** é um grupo de playlists com o mesmo `batchName`. 
Cada **playlist** tem seu próprio `id` no Firestore.

### Problema: Regenerate Muda IDs

Quando o usuário regenera playlists, o algoritmo cria **novos objetos** com **novos IDs**:

```
Antes:                        Após Regenerate:
id="abc" batchName="V1"  →   id="xyz" batchName="V1" (ID NOVO!)
```

### Solução: Save por batchName (Delete + Save)

Na EditPlaylistView, o Save deve:
1. **Deletar** todos documentos onde `batchName === currentBatchName`
2. **Salvar** as novas playlists com o mesmo `batchName`

```javascript
// Pseudo-código
async function saveEditedBatch(batchName, newPlaylists) {
  // 1. Deletar batch antigo
  const oldPlaylists = await repo.findByBatchName(batchName)
  for (const p of oldPlaylists) {
    await repo.delete(p.id)
  }
  
  // 2. Salvar novas playlists
  for (const p of newPlaylists) {
    p.batchName = batchName // garantir mesmo batchName
    await repo.save(p)
  }
}
```

### Diferença: CREATE vs EDIT Mode

| Aspecto | CREATE Mode | EDIT Mode |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Entrada** | `/playlists` | `/playlists?edit=batchName` |
| **Carregar** | Store vazio | Firestore (fresh) |
| **Regenerate** | IDs novos | IDs novos, mas batchName mantido |
| **Save** | Cria batch NOVO | Deleta antigo + Salva novo |

### Suporte a Renomear Batch

Para permitir que o usuário renomeie o batch (ex: "Greatest Hits" → "Best of 2024"):

```javascript
// EditPlaylistView
class EditPlaylistView {
  mount(params) {
    this.originalBatchName = params.edit  // Guardar nome original da URL
    this.currentBatchName = params.edit   // Nome atual (pode mudar)
  }
  
  async save() {
    // 1. Deletar pelo nome ORIGINAL (não o atual)
    await deleteByBatchName(this.originalBatchName)
    
    // 2. Salvar com o novo nome
    for (const p of playlists) {
      p.batchName = this.currentBatchName  // Novo nome se mudou
      await repo.save(p)
    }
  }
}
```

Isso permite:
- ✅ Editar sem mudar nome
- ✅ Editar E renomear batch
- ✅ Regenerar e salvar

## Technical Strategies

### Playlist Persistence Strategy (Batch Management)

When editing or regenerating playlists, the system treats the batch as a unit. Since regeneration creates new playlist objects with new IDs, the save process handles versioning and renaming:

1. **Delete** all existing playlists where `batchName === originalBatchName`
2. **Save** all current playlists with `batchName = newBatchName`

This strategy prevents "ghost playlists" (orphaned tracks from previous generations) and supports batch renaming in a single atomic-like operation.

### Cache Strategy (2-Level + Source of Truth)

The system uses a unified `CacheManager` with a 2-level architecture, falling back to Firestore/API only when necessary.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Request[Data Request] --> L1{L1: Memory?}
    L1 -- Yes --> ReturnL1[Return Data (Fastest)]
    L1 -- No --> L2{L2: IndexedDB?}
    L2 -- Yes --> ReturnL2[Return Data (Fast)]
    L2 -- No --> Source{Source: Firestore/API}
    Source --> Cache[Update Cache L1+L2]
    Cache --> ReturnSource[Return Data]
```

1. **L1: Memory Cache** (Session-only, Map-based)
2. **L2: IndexedDB** (Persistent, 7-day TTL default)
3. **Source of Truth**: Firestore (User Data) or Apple/Spotify APIs (Metadata)

--------------------------------------------------
# Architecture Balance Analysis: Frontend vs Backend

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Subject**: Architectural Distribution Analysis (Thick Client vs Thin Server)
**Based on**: Codebase Quantitative Scan (v10.1) & Product Vision

---

## 1. The Current Reality (The "90/10" Split)

Our quantitative analysis revealed a distinct **"Thick Client"** architecture:

*   **Frontend (Browser)**: ~25,000 LOC (Logics, Views, State)
*   **Backend (Server)**: ~2,500 LOC (Proxy, Scrapers, Auth)

This **10:1 ratio** places `90%` of the application complexity inside the user's browser. The Backend acts primarily as a "dumb pipe" for data fetching (scraping) and secure token exchange.

---

## 2. Is this balance correct?

**Short Answer: YES, but with a structural warning.**

Given the **Product Vision** ("User Sovereignty", "Complementary Intelligence") and the specific constraints of this application, this distribution is generally **intentional and beneficial**.

### ✅ Why the "Thick Client" works for The Album Blender:

1.  **Iterative Interactivity (The "Blender" Metaphor)**
    *   **User Need**: Users tweak algorithms, drag-and-drop tracks, and regenerate playlists repeatedly.
    *   **Tech implication**: Moving ranking/sorting logic to the backend would introduce **network latency** for every slider adjustment. Doing it in the browser ensures "instant" feedback (60fps), essential for a tool that feels like an instrument.

2.  **Cost & Scalability (Cloud Run Economics)**
    *   **Current**: Heavy sorting/balancing algorithms run on the **User's CPU** (Free).
    *   **backend-heavy**: Running these CPU-intensive loops on Node.js/Cloud Run would significantly increase compute costs and require scaling instances for concurrent users.

3.  **Data Sovereignty & Offline Potential**
    *   **Vision Compliance**: The data belongs to the user (`User Sovereignty`).
    *   **Future**: A thick client architecture is 80% of the way to a **PWA (Progressive Web App)** that effectively works "offline-first", syncing only when needed.

4.  **Dataset Size**
    *   **Scale**: We are processing Series of ~10-100 albums. Modern JavaScript engines (V8) can sort/filter arrays of this size in **microseconds**. We are not crunching Big Data that *requires* server-side processing.

---

## 3. The "Findins": Where the imbalance hurts

While the *topology* (Front vs Back) is correct, the *internal structure* of the Frontend is suffering from the weight.

### 🔴 The Real Problem: "Frontend Monoliths"

The 25k lines are not evenly distributed. They are clumped into **"God Views"** and **"God Objects"**:

1.  **Logic Leaks**: Business logic (e.g., Filtering, Ranking) often lives inside View files (`SeriesView`) rather than pure logic modules. This makes the frontend feel "heavier" than it is because UI and Logic are coupled.
2.  **Bundle Size**: A 25k LOC bundle takes time to parse and execute.
3.  **State Complexity**: Managing strictly consistent state (Undo/Redo, Sync) across 25k lines of vanilla JS is exponentially harder than in a strict framework or Backend DB.

### 🔍 Specific Findings:

| Area | Status | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ranking Algorithms** | Frontend | **KEEP**. Requires instant interactivity. |
| **Data Normalization** | Mixed | **MOVE TO BACKEND**. The server should return "Clean" data. Currently, the client does too much data patching (fixing "Thriller" bugs, etc). |
| **API Integration** | Backend | **KEEP**. Secure keys must stay on server. |
| **HTML Generation** | Frontend | **REFACTOR**. The Views are generating too much HTML string logic. |

---

## 4. Recommendations

Do **NOT** rewrite the application to be server-side rendered (SSR) or move core logic to the backend. Instead, **professionalize the Frontend Architecture**.

### 1. Refactor, Don't Relocate
*   **Action**: Aggressively decouple Logic from Views (Sprint 17).
*   **Goal**: The `SeriesView.js` should be 200 lines of UI binding, effectively "dumb". The complex logic (filtering, sorting) should be in `SeriesController.js` and `SeriesFilterService.js`.

### 2. Strengthen the "BFF" (Backend for Frontend) Contract
*   **Action**: The Backend should return data that is **100% ready to use**.
*   **Current**: Backend returns raw scraped data → Frontend normalizes/patches it.
*   **Future**: Backend normalizes EVERYTHING. Frontend assumes data is perfect. This reduces frontend "defensive coding" bloat.

### 3. Embrace the "App" Nature
*   Since this is a Thick Client, treat it like a Desktop App.
*   Invest in **Service Workers** (caching) to make the large bundle load instantly on subsequent visits.

## 5. Summary

We have built a **Desktop-class Application running in the Browser**. This is a valid modern architectural choice (like Figma or VS Code). The "weight" on the frontend is a feature, not a bug—provided we manage the code quality strictly.

**Recommendation**: Stay the course on Architecture. Double down on **Modularization**.

--------------------------------------------------
# Análise de Metodologia para Sprint 6 (Authentication)

**Data**: 2025-12-10
**Status**: Draft
**Escopo**: Sprint 6 (Google/Apple Auth + User Persistence)

---

## 1. Contexto & Desafio

O Sprint 6 introduz Autenticação (OAuth 2.0 com Google e Apple) e Persistência de Dados de Usuário Firestore. Diferente dos sprints anteriores focados em lógica local e UI, este sprint envolve:

1.  **Integrações Externas**: Dependência de provedores de identidade (IdP) reais ou mockados.
2.  **Segurança**: Manipulação de tokens e sessões.
3.  **Estado Assíncrono**: O fluxo de login é inerentemente assíncrono e redirecionado.

A questão é: **Qual metodologia (TDD, BDD, Spec-Driven) é mais viável e benéfica para implementar a v2.2.0?**

---

## 2. Análise Comparativa

### A. TDD (Test-Driven Development) Clássico

*Foco: Escrever teste de unidade/integração antes do código.*

**Prós:**
*   **Design de Código:** Força desacoplamento. Útil para a `UserStore` e lógica de persistência.
*   **Feedback Rápido:** Testes unitários rodando no Vitest (in-memory) são rápidos.
*   **Segurança:** Garante que edge cases (ex: token inválido, erro de rede) sejam tratados.

**Contras no Sprint 6:**
*   **Integração Difícil:** Testar o "clique no botão de login do Google" via TDD requer mocks complexos do SDK do Firebase Auth.
*   **Falso Positivo:** Mocks excessivos podem mascarar mudanças nas APIs reais.

**Viabilidade:** Alta para *User Data Persistence* e gestão de estado. Baixa para *fluxos de UI de Auth*.

### B. BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)

*Foco: Gherkin/Cucumber. "Dado que estou na tela de login, Quando clico em Google..."*

**Prós:**
*   **Documentação Viva:** Alinha com o desejo de documentação forte do projeto.
*   **Linguagem Ubíqua:** Aproxima requisitos técnicos de requisitos de negócio.

**Contras no Sprint 6:**
*   **Overhead Tecnológico:** Requer configurar Cucumber/Jest-Cucumber sobre o Puppeteer/Vitest atual.
*   **Manutenção:** Steps definitions tendem a ficar obsoletos em projetos com ritmo rápido.
*   **Autenticação E2E:** Login real com Google/Apple em CI/CD é notoriamente difícil (bloqueio de bots, 2FA).

**Viabilidade:** Média-Baixa. O custo de setup e manutenção para um sprint curto (1 semana) pode não compensar.

### C. Spec-Driven Development (Github Spec Kit Style)

*Foco: Design detalhado (Markdown) antes do código. "Escrever a spec, revisar, codar".*

**Prós:**
*   **Alinhamento Total:** O projeto já usa documentação pesada (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`).
*   **Claridade Antes da Execução:** Define exatamente *o que* testar manuamente ou automatizar.
*   **Sem Overhead de Tooling:** É processo, não biblioteca.

**Contras no Sprint 6:**
*   **Não Automatizado:** A spec não falha o build se o código divergir (depende de disciplina humana).

**Viabilidade:** Muito Alta. Combina com o fluxo atual de "Implementation Plan".

---

## 3. Desafios Técnicos de Auth em Testes

Para aplicar qualquer metodologia automatizada (TDD/BDD), precisamos resolver:

1.  **Mocking do Firebase Auth:**
    *   Não podemos depender da UI real do Google/Apple nos testes automatizados.
    *   *Solução:* Usar `firebase-auth-emulator` localmente ou mockar o método `signInWithPopup`.

2.  **Puppeteer E2E:**
    *   O Puppeteer não consegue interagir facilmente com popups de terceiros (Google Auth) que têm proteções anti-bot.
    *   *Abordagem:* Em testes E2E, injetar um estado "logado" programaticamente em vez de clicar no botão de login.

---

## 4. Recomendação: Abordagem Híbrida "Spec-First TDD"

Para o Sprint 6, recomendamos uma abordagem pragmática que extrai o melhor dos três mundos sem overhead excessivo:

### 1. Spec-Driven Design (Fase de Planejamento)
Em vez de pular para o código, escreveremos um **Technical Spec** (similar ao Spec Kit) detalhando:
*   Fluxo de Dados (Auth Provider -> App -> Firestore)
*   Modelo de Dados (`/users/{uid}`)
*   Estados da UI (Guest, Authenticating, Authenticated, Error)

### 2. TDD para Lógica de Negócio (Fase de Execução)
Usar TDD rigoroso (Vitest) para:
*   `UserStore`: Testar transições de estado (login, logout, hydrate).
*   `AuthService`: Testar tratamento de erros e formatação de dados.
*   *Ferramenta*: Vitest com `vi.mock` do Firebase SDK.

### 3. "Behavior-Like" E2E Tests (Fase de Verificação)
Não usar Cucumber, mas escrever testes Puppeteer focados em comportamento:
*   *Cenário 1*: Usuário já logado vê sua foto e playlists.
*   *Cenário 2*: Persistência funciona após refresh.
*   *Mock Strategy*: Usar uma flag de teste para simular Auth bem-sucedido sem bater no Google.

---

## 5. Próximos Passos Propostos

1.  Criar `docs/specs/SPRINT6_AUTH_SPEC.md` com o design técnico.
2.  Configurar mocks do Firebase Auth no setup do Vitest.
3.  Implementar `UserStore` usando TDD.
4.  Implementar UI.

Esta abordagem garante qualidade (TDD) e clareza (Spec) sem paralisar o desenvolvimento com setup de ferramentas complexas (BDD puro).

--------------------------------------------------
# Codebase Health Assessment: God Classes Report
**Date**: 2025-12-31
**Context**: Preparation for Sprint 17 (Refactoring)

## Overview
Three critical files have been identified as "God Classes" or maintainability bottlenecks requiring immediate refactoring.

---

## 1. `MusicKitService.js` (811 LOC) - 🚨 CRITICAL
**Problem**: Violation of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
This service handles:
- Authorization & Token Management
- Catalog Search & Normalization
- Library Management (Playlists, Folders)
- Storefront/Region Logic
- Similarity Scoring Logic

**Impact**: High coupling makes changes risky (e.g. changing auth logic might break search). Testing is difficult.

**Proposed Refactoring (Sprint 17)**:
Break into valid facade services:
- `MusicKitAuth.js`: Auth state, tokens, storefront detection (`getBrowserStorefront`).
- `MusicKitCatalog.js`: Search, discography fetch, album details.
- `MusicKitLibrary.js`: Create playlist, folder management.
- `MusicKitService.js`: Main facade that coordinates the above (backward compatibility).

---

## 2. `albumSeries.js` (588 LOC) - 🚨 CRITICAL
**Problem**: Massive Code Duplication & Corruption.
- The class methods (`createSeries`, `updateSeries`, etc.) are defined **twice**: once before the constructor and once after.
- This indicates a bad merge or copy-paste error.
- The file is unnecessarily long and confusing.

**Proposed Refactoring (Sprint 16/17)**:
- Immediate cleanup of duplicate methods.
- Verify which version of the methods is the correct/latest one.

---

## 3. `curation.js` (518 LOC) - ⚠️ HIGH
**Problem**: Mixed concerns in Core Logic.
- **Enrichment**: 160 lines of fetching/scoring/normalizing.
- **Generation**: 130 lines of playlist allocation.
- **Balancing**: 45 lines of specialized swap logic.

**Impact**: Adding new algorithms (Phase 4, S-Draft) bloats this file further.

**Proposed Refactoring (Sprint 17)**:
- Extract `EnrichmentService` for track scoring/metadata.
- Implement **Strategy Pattern** for generation algorithms:
    - `PlaylistGenerator.js` (Context)
    - `GenerationStrategy` (Interface)
    - `CascadeStrategy.js`
    - `BalancedSwapStrategy.js`

---

## Roadmap Integration
These findings justify a dedicated **Sprint 17: Architectural Modularization**.
scope:
1. Fix `albumSeries.js` (Quick Win)
2. Modularize `MusicKitService` (High Effort)
3. Refactor `curation.js` (Medium Effort)

# Code Quality Assessment v11.0 (Sprint 17 Modularization)

**Date**: 2026-01-04
**Scope**: Full Project Audit (V2 Protocol)
**Protocol Version**: [Code Quality Assessment Protocol v2.0](../../../.agent/workflows/code_quality_assessment_protocol.md)

---

## 📊 Executive Scorecard

| Metric Group | Specific Metric | Target | Current | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Componentization** | **Atomic Density** | > 70% | **~40%** | 🟠 High (Mixed "Smart" components) |
| | **Reuse Factor** | > 30% | **~60%** | 🟢 Good (Core UI used everywhere) |
| **Modularization** | **Layer Violations** | 0 | **0** | 🔵 Clean Boundaries |
| | **Logic Isolation** | 100% | **100%** | 🔵 Services are Pure |
| **Tech Health** | **God Class Ratio** | < 10% | **15%** | 🟡 3 Views > 500 LOC/20KB |
| | **SafeDOM Usage** | 100% | **100%** | 🔵 SafeDOM Migration Complete |

---

## 🔍 Deep Audit Findings (V2 Protocol)

### 1. Layer Compliance (Strict Boundaries)
- **Views**: ✅ PASSED. No Views were found importing Repositories directly.
- **Controllers**: ✅ PASSED. `SeriesController` interacts with Views via explicit methods (`setView`, `update`), not direct DOM access.
- **Services**: ✅ PASSED. `PlaylistGenerationService` is a model of purity—input/output only, no side effects.

### 2. Design Pattern Integrity
- **Observer Pattern**: Controllers correctly subscribe/unsubscribe to Store updates.
- **Strategy Pattern**: All Algorithms (Cascade, Top N, etc.) implement the consistent `generate()` interface.
- **Passive View**: `SeriesView` is now a "Thin Orchestrator". Most logic resides in `SeriesController`, though the View is still verbose (500+ LOC) due to DOM assembly.

### 3. Cognitive Load & Readability
- **Hotspots Identified**:
    - `SeriesController.js` (420 LOC): Handles Filter, CheckStore, API, and View updates. Cohesion is straining.
    - `BlendingMenuView.js` (18KB): Likely a "God View" containing too much internal state logic.
    - `SavedPlaylistsView.js` (20KB): Needs breakdown.

### 4. Component Atomicity
- **UI Libraries**: `components/ui/` contains excellent "Atomic" components (`Card`, `TrackRow`, `BaseModal`).
- **Mixed Bag**: The root `components/` folder is cluttered. Many components (`SpotifyExportModal`, `ViewAlbumModal`) are "Smart" (injected with dependencies) but live alongside "Dumb" components.

---

## 🔴 Priority Matrix (Top Refactor Targets)

| File | Score | Main Violation | Actionable Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `public/js/views/SavedPlaylistsView.js` | 🟠 4 | **God View (20KB)** | Split into `SavedSeriesList` and `SavedBatchDetails` components. |
| `public/js/views/BlendingMenuView.js` | 🟠 4 | **God View (18KB)** | Move state logic to `BlendingController`. |
| `public/js/controllers/SeriesController.js` | 🟡 6 | **Bloated (420 LOC)** | Extract `SeriesSearchService` and `SeriesFilterService` completely. |

---

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate (Sprint 18)
1.  **Extract Filtering Logic**: Move `SeriesController` filtering methods completely to `SeriesFilterService` to drop Controller size below 300 LOC.
2.  **Organize Components**: Move "Smart" feature components to `public/js/features/` or `public/js/views/components/` to separate them from the global "Dumb" UI library.

### Architectural (Long-term)
1.  **Blending Controller**: `BlendingMenuView` is acting as a Controller. Create a formal `BlendingController.js` to manage the complex recipe state.
2.  **View Decomposition**: Continue the pattern of `SeriesView` (Passive View) for `SavedPlaylistsView` and `BlendingMenuView`.

---

## ✅ Assessment Conclusion
The architecture has successfully transitioned to a **Safe, Modular, and Pattern-Driven** state. The "V3 Refactor" is architecturally sound. The remaining debt is primarily **Metric-based** (file sizes) rather than **Structural** (bad patterns). We are ready for Feature Development with a stable foundation.



# FILE: C:\Users\Mauricio Pedroso\VibeCoding\MyProjects\MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0\docs\archive\2025_technical\code_quality\PROTOCOL.md
--------------------------------------------------
# Code Quality Assessment Protocol (Reference)

## Overview
This directory contains historical evaluations of the MJRP Albums Balanced Playlists codebase. To execute a new assessment, follow the automated protocol.

## Protocol Execution
The official, step-by-step protocol is located at:
`[code-quality-assessment-protocol.md](../../../.agent/workflows/code_quality_assessment_protocol.md)`

## Core Assessment Philosophy
1.  **Metric-Driven**: Use Lines of Code (LOC) and File Counts to track growth and modularization.
2.  **Architectural Alignment**: Ensure every new feature follows established MVC, Repository, and Strategy patterns.
3.  **Technical Debt Visibility**: Use the 1-10 scoring system to highlight critical refactoring needs before they block future development.

## Historical Assessments

---

## 1. Quick Start - Deploy em Produção

### Frontend (Firebase Hosting)

```bash
./scripts/deploy-prod.sh
```

Este script automaticamente:
- Executa `npm run build`
- Copia arquivos estáticos para `dist/`
- Faz `firebase deploy --only hosting`

### Backend (Cloud Run)

```bash
./scripts/deploy-backend.sh
```

Este script automaticamente:
- Copia `shared/` para o contexto do Docker
- Faz build e deploy via `gcloud run deploy`

---

## 2. Desenvolvimento Local

### Pré-requisitos

- Node.js 18.x e npm
- Python 3 (para servidor estático) ou `npx serve`
- Arquivo `server/.env` com `AI_API_KEY=...`

### Start (um comando)

```bash
./scripts/start-local.sh
```

O script:
- Instala dependências (`npm ci` em `server/`)
- Inicia backend em `localhost:3000`
- Inicia frontend em `localhost:8000`
- Salva logs em `.local_logs/`

### Stop

```bash
./scripts/stop-local.sh
```

### Verificações úteis

```bash
# Health check
curl -sS http://localhost:3000/_health | jq

# Teste de album
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"albumQuery":"Radiohead - OK Computer"}' | jq

# Tail logs
tail -f .local_logs/server.log
```

---

## 3. Configuração de Portas

> [!CAUTION]
> **Port 5173 é o default do Vite MAS NÃO É USADO neste projeto.**
> Sempre use as portas documentadas abaixo.

| Porta | Propósito | Configuração | Comando |
|-------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **5000** | Dev Server (Vite) | `vite.config.js:30` | `npm run dev` |
| **5005** | Preview/E2E Tests | `test/e2e/helpers.js:6` | `npm run preview` |
| **3000** | Backend API | `server/index.js` | `cd server && node index.js` |
| **8000** | Static Server (dev) | `start-local.sh` | Python http.server |

### Verificação

```bash
# Verificar porta do dev server
grep -n "port:" vite.config.js
# Expected: "30:        port: 5000,"
```

---

## 4. Production Readiness Checklist

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Checklist baseado nos Issues #33 e #34 do DEBUG_LOG.md para evitar problemas recorrentes.

### 🔧 Frontend Deploy

#### Pre-Build
- [ ] `firebase.json` está com `"public": "dist"` (NÃO `"public"`)
- [ ] Nenhuma dependência está em `external` no `vite.config.js` (axios, etc.)
- [ ] Sem CDN scripts desnecessários no `index.html`

#### Build
- [ ] `npm run build` executa sem erros
- [ ] Build output está em `dist/` (não `public/`)
- [ ] `dist/assets/main-*.js` existe e tem tamanho > 100KB

#### Static Files
- [ ] `firebase-config.js` copiado para `dist/js/`
- [ ] `css/modals.css` copiado para `dist/css/`
- [ ] Outros assets copiados

> **Nota**: `./scripts/deploy-prod.sh` faz tudo isso automaticamente.

### 🖥️ Backend Deploy

#### Pre-Deploy
- [ ] `shared/` folder contém:
  - `normalize.js` ✅
  - `curation.js` ✅ (adicionado em 2025-12-10)
- [ ] `server/index.js` importa de `../shared/` (NÃO de `../public/`)
- [ ] Nenhum import de `../public/js/` no código do servidor

#### Container Structure
```
/usr/src/app/      → server code (index.js, lib/, etc.)
/usr/src/shared/   → shared modules (normalize.js, curation.js)
```

**NÃO deve ter**: `/usr/src/public/` (frontend é separado)

### ✅ Post-Deploy Validation

#### Frontend
- [ ] App carrega sem erros no console
- [ ] Sem erros de "Failed to resolve module specifier"
- [ ] Firebase Auth inicializa corretamente

#### Backend
- [ ] `/api/generate` (Load Albums) funciona
- [ ] `/api/playlists` (Generate Playlists) funciona - retorna 200
- [ ] Logs do Cloud Run sem erros 500

#### Smoke Tests
- [ ] Criar nova série
- [ ] Carregar álbuns via Load Albums
- [ ] Gerar playlists
- [ ] Navegar entre views (Home, Albums, Playlists, Inventory)

---

## 5. Segurança e Secrets

### Princípios

- ❌ **NUNCA** commitar API keys no repositório
- ✅ Use variáveis de ambiente
- ✅ O proxy server (`/server`) mantém secrets no backend

### Configuração

1. Copie `.env.example` para `server/.env`
2. Preencha `AI_API_KEY` e opcionalmente `AI_ENDPOINT`
3. Para deploy, configure secrets no Secret Manager do GCP

### Validação com AJV

O servidor usa `ajv` para validar respostas do AI provider:

```bash
cd server
npm install ajv
node index.js
```

Se vir respostas `422`, verifique logs para "Album validation failed".

### Endpoints úteis

| Endpoint | Método | Descrição |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| `/_health` | GET | Health check (`{ ok: true }`) |
| `/api/list-models` | GET | Lista modelos disponíveis |
| `/api/generate` | POST | Gera album (`{ albumQuery }`) |
| `/api/playlists` | POST | Gera playlists (`{ albums, options }`) |

---

## 6. Rotação de Secrets

### Passo a Passo (Console UI)

1. **Criar nova versão do segredo**
   - Console → Secret Manager → `AI_API_KEY` → "Add new version"
   - Cole a nova chave, salve

2. **Verificar permissões**
   - Cloud Run → `mjrp-proxy` → anotar Service Account
   - IAM → verificar `Secret Manager Secret Accessor`

3. **Criar nova revisão do Cloud Run**
   - Cloud Run → `mjrp-proxy` → "Edit & Deploy New Revision"
   - Variables & Secrets → Add secret → `AI_API_KEY` → Version = `Latest`
   - Environment variables: `ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app`
   - Deploy

4. **Verificação pós-deploy**
   ```bash
   # Cloud Run
   curl -i https://<cloud-run-url>/_health

   # Via Firebase Hosting
   curl -i https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app/api/generate \
     -H "Origin: https://mjrp-playlist-generator.web.app" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"albumQuery":"Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin I"}'
   ```

5. **Revogar chave antiga** no provedor (após confirmar nova funcionando)

6. **Limpeza** - Desabilitar versões antigas no Secret Manager

### Checklist antes de revogar

- [ ] Nova revisão do Cloud Run está `Ready`
- [ ] Logs sem erros 403/401
- [ ] Endpoint retorna 200 com CORS correto
- [ ] Smoke tests funcionais

---

## 7. Rollback Procedures

### Frontend (Firebase Hosting)

```bash
# Via CLI
firebase hosting:channel:deploy previous

# Via Console:
# Hosting → Release History → "Rollback to this version"
```

### Backend (Cloud Run)

```bash
# Listar revisões
gcloud run revisions list --service=mjrp-proxy --region=southamerica-east1

# Rollback para revisão específica
gcloud run services update-traffic mjrp-proxy \
  --to-revisions=mjrp-proxy-XXXXX=100 \
  --region=southamerica-east1

# Via Console:
# Cloud Run → mjrp-proxy → Revisions → Split traffic
```

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

### "I'm getting 404 on localhost:5173"

**Problema**: Porta errada.  
**Solução**: Use `http://localhost:5000`

### "npm run dev starts on random port"

**Problema**: Porta 5000 já em uso.  
**Solução**:
```bash
lsof -i :5000  # Encontrar processo
kill -9 <PID>  # Matar processo
```

### "503 from /api/generate"

**Problema**: `AI_API_KEY` não configurado.  
**Solução**: Configurar em `server/.env` ou variáveis de ambiente.

### "CORS error on API calls"

**Problema**: Origin não permitido.  
**Solução**: Verificar `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` no Cloud Run inclui o domínio correto.

### "Failed to resolve module specifier 'axios'"

**Problema**: `firebase.json` com `"public": "public"`.  
**Solução**: Mudar para `"public": "dist"` e rodar `./scripts/deploy-prod.sh`.

### "/api/playlists retorna 500"

**Problema**: Import de `../public/js/curation.js` no servidor.  
**Solução**: Usar `../shared/curation.js` e verificar que `shared/curation.js` existe.

# MJRP Architectural Audit & Deep Dive (Holistic)

**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Scope**: Server & Public (Full Stack)
**Inspector**: Antigravity (Agent)

---

## 1. Introduction: The "Hybrid" Reality

The **MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0** project is currently in a transitional state between a legacy jQuery/Vanilla JS prototype (V1/V2) and a modern, modular architecture (V3).
While recent sprints (like Sprint 17.75) have achieved excellent modularity in specific domains, the broader system exhibits a **"Pattern Schizophrenia"** where modern principles clash with legacy habits.

This audit goes beyond line counts to analyze the *fidelity* of our patterns and the *integrity* of our modularization.

---

## 2. Server-Side Analysis

### 🔴 The "Fat Route" Anti-Pattern
**Compliance**: 🔴 Critical Violation
**Observation**:
The file `server/routes/albums.js` contains 288 lines of mixed responsibility code.
- **Route Handling**: `router.post('/generate', ...)` (Correct)
- **Business Logic**: Prompt rendering, AI response parsing, validation (Should be in Service)
- **Data Aggregation**: Orchestrating BestEver + AI + Ranking consolidation (Should be in Service)

**Critique**:
The "Controller" layer is missing on the server. We are leaking complex orchestration logic directly into Express route handlers. This makes testing impossible without spinning up a full HTTP server.

**Recommendation**:
Extract `AlbumGenerationService` and `EnrichmentService`. The route should look like:
```javascript
router.post('/generate', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const result = await AlbumGenerationService.generate(req.body);
        res.json(result);
    } catch (e) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: e.message });
    }
});
```

### 🟢 Service Layer Integrity
**Compliance**: 🟢 Good
**Observation**:
`server/lib/aiClient.js` is a clean, reusable wrapper around the AI provider. It correctly abstracts the prompt injection and model selection.
**Success**: It allows swapping models (Gemini 2.5 Flash) without breaking consumers, fulfilling the **Open/Closed Principle**.

---

## 3. Client-Side (Public) Analysis

### 🟠 "Fake" Componentization (The Wrapper Illusion)
**Compliance**: 🟠 Mixed
**Observation**:
We have introduced a `Component` base class (Sprint 15), but many implementations are just **wrappers around legacy string concatenators**.
- **Evidence**: `SeriesGridRenderer.js` uses `import { renderAlbumsGrid } from '../../views/albums/AlbumsGridRenderer.js'`.
- It calls the legacy function which returns a huge HTML string, then injects it via `SafeDOM.fromHTML()`.
- **Impact**: This provides the *illusion* of componentization but retains the monolith's performance characteristics (full re-render on any change) and prevents true fine-grained reactivity.

### 🔴 The `innerHTML` addiction
**Compliance**: 🔴 Critical Violation (Constitution II)
**Observation**:
Despite strict rules, `SeriesToolbar.js` and `DiscographyToolbar.js` render via template literals:
```javascript
this.container.innerHTML = `... <div class="toolbar"> ...`
```
- **Why this is bad**: It destroys all event listeners attached to child elements whenever the parent re-renders. It forces us to re-bind events manually (`bindEvents()`), creating "Hidden Complexity" and bugs where buttons stop working after a refresh.

### 🟢 Store Pattern Fidelity
**Compliance**: 🟢 Excellent
**Observation**:
`AlbumsStore.js` and `PlaylistsStore.js` are implementing the pattern correctly.
- **State Isolation**: Logic for "Active Series" vs "Global" is well managed.
- **Reactivity**: The Observer pattern (`subscribe()`) allows views to react to data changes without tight coupling.
- **Persistence**: Firestore logic is clearly separated within the Store, keeping Controllers clean of database calls.

---

## 4. Modularization & File Structure

### 🟢 Domain Driven Design (Emergent)
**Compliance**: 🟢 Good
**Observation**:
The directory structure is evolving correctly towards DDD:
- `services/album-search/` contains the *entire* domain logic for searching and classifying.
- `components/series/` groups all Series-related UI.
- **Success**: Code is co-located by *Feature* rather than just *Type*.

### 🔴 Utility Sprawl
**Compliance**: 🟠 Warning
**Observation**:
We have `utils/stringUtils.js`, `helpers/SpotifyEnrichmentHelper.js`, `services/SeriesFilterService.js`.
The distinction between a "Helper", a "Utility", and a "Service" is blurry.
- `SeriesFilterService` looks like a pure utility function collection but is named a service.
- **Recommendation**: Formalize naming. "Service" = Stateful/Async. "Utility" = Pure logic.

---

## 5. Strategic Roadmap (Corrective Actions)

### Priority 1: Server Logic Extraction (Architecture)
Move logic out of `server/routes/albums.js` immediately. This is technical debt that risks breaking the generation pipeline as complexity grows.

### Priority 2: True Componentization (Frontend)
Stop wrapping string-builders in Components.
- Refactor `SeriesGridRenderer` to iterate and render `Card` components *individually* as DOM nodes.
- This unlocks **Virtual DOM-like efficiency** (only update changed cards) and fixes the event binding hell.

### Priority 3: SafeDOM Enforcement
Modify the `Component` base class to **throw an error** if `render()` returns a string. It must return a DOM Node (HTMLElement). This forces developers to use `SafeDOM`.

---

## 6. Final Verdict

**Architectural Maturity Level**: **Level 2 (Managed)**
*Process is characterized for projects and is often reactive.*

We have the *structure* (folders, class names) of a mature Level 3 (Defined) architecture, but the *implementation details* (innerHTML, fat routes) often revert to Level 1 (Ad-hoc) behaviors.

**The "Constitution Test"**:
- **User-Centric**: Pass. The app works well for the user.
- **Clean Code**: Fail. `innerHTML` violations are widespread.
- **Modular**: Pass. High-level modules are good.

We are on the right path, but we must stop "cheating" with `innerHTML` wrappers to reach the next level.

--------------------------------------------------
# Code Quality Assessment v9.0

**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Focus**: Holistic Analysis (Server & Public), Architecture Compliance, Sprint 17.75 Impact
**Inspector**: Antigravity (Agent)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This assessment follows the completion of **Sprint 17.75 (Album Classification Modularization)**.
The codebase is in a **Hybrid State**:
1.  **New Architecture (V3)**: The *Classification System* (`AlbumTypeClassifier`, Strategies) is a model of Clean Code, implementing Strategy Pattern and SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) perfectly.
2.  **Legacy Debt**: The *View Layer* (`SeriesView`, `PlaylistsView`) and *Components* are suffering from **Bloat** and **SafeDOM violations**. Widespread `innerHTML` usage persists despite previous directives.

**Overall Score**: 🟡 **6/10 (Acceptable but Fragile)**

---

## 2. Quantitative Scan

### A. Size Metrics (The "God Class" Radar)

| File | Type | LOC | Status | Limit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SeriesView.js` | View | **504** | 🔴 Critical | 350 |
| `SeriesController.js` | Controller | **420** | 🔴 High | 300 |
| `PlaylistsController.js` | Controller | **381** | 🟠 High | 300 |
| `PlaylistsView.js` | View | 342 | 🟡 Borderline | 350 |
| `AlbumSearchService.js` | Service | 296 | 🟢 Good | 200* |
| `AlbumTypeClassifier.js` | Service | 195 | 🟢 Excellent | 200 |

*> Note: AlbumSearchService is acceptable as it orchestrates complex logic, but nearing the limit.*

### B. Layer Violations (Strictness)

- **View -> Repository**: ✅ **0 Violations**. Views correctly use Controllers/Stores.
- **Controller -> DOM**: ⚠️ **1 Violation**.
    - `PlaylistsController.js` (Line 277): `document.querySelector('#saveToHistoryBtn')`. Logic should strictly bind data; View should update UI.
- **Service -> UI**: ✅ **0 Violations**. Services are pure.

### C. Tech Health (SafeDOM Compliance)

**Metric**: SafeDOM usage vs `innerHTML`
**Target**: 100% SafeDOM / 0% `innerHTML`
**Actual**: **FAILURE** 🔴

Significant `innerHTML` usage detected in core components:
- `SeriesView.js` (Line 289): `mount.innerHTML = ...`
- `SeriesToolbar.js`: Uses HTML template strings.
- `DiscographyToolbar.js`: Uses HTML template strings.
- `Autocomplete.js`, `ArtistScanner.js`, `Toast.js`, `TopNav.js`: All rely on `innerHTML`.

> **Risk**: This contradicts **Constitution Principle II** ("Clean Code") and makes XSS mitigation difficult. It also creates "Hidden Complexity" where event listeners are lost during re-renders.

---

## 3. Qualitative Analysis (Holistic)

### A. Architecture & Patterns (The Good)

The **Classification Modularization (Sprint 17.75)** is a success story.
- **Strategy Pattern**: The `AlbumTypeClassifier` -> `BaseStrategy` implementation is textbook. It allows adding new strategies (like `TypeSanityCheck`) without touching the orchestrator.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The distinction between *searching* (`AlbumSearchService`) and *classifying* (`AlbumTypeClassifier`) is clear and robust.
- **Store Pattern**: `albumsStore` and `playlistsStore` are effectively decoupled effectively from the UI.

### B. Componentization (The Bad)

The project struggles with **"View Bloat"**.
- `SeriesView` attempts to be a "Thin Orchestrator" but ends up managing too many sub-component lifecycles and DOM mount points manually.
- **Components are not atomic**. Many components (`SeriesToolbar`, `DiscographyToolbar`) function as simple HTML string generators rather than true interactive components with internal state management.
- **Lack of Standardization**: Some components use `SafeDOM`, others use `innerHTML`. This inconsistency increases cognitive load.

### C. Constitution Alignment

| Principle | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. User-Centric Quality** | 🟢 Good | UI fits the "Analysis" vibe. Classification accuracy (Ferry Corsten/Pink Floyd) directly improves UX. |
| **II. Clean Code** | 🟠 Mixed | Backend/Services are clean. Frontend Views are messy. `innerHTML` is a major violation. |
| **III. Documentation** | 🟢 Exemplary | `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEBUG_LOG.md`, and Specs are up-to-date and actively used. |
| **IV. Spec-Driven** | 🟢 Exemplary | Sprint 17.75 followed the Spec -> Plan -> Impl -> Verify flow perfectly. |

---

## 4. Recommendations

### 🎯 Immediate / High Impact
1.  **Refactor `SeriesView`**: Break it down. Extract the "Mounting Logic" into a `ComponentRegistry` or simplify the render loop.
2.  **Fix `PlaylistsController`**: Remove direct DOM access. Use a callback or Observable state to notify the View to update the button.

### 🛡️ Strategic / Long Term
3.  **Operation SafeDOM**: Launch a dedicated "Tech Debt Sprint" to eradicate `innerHTML` from:
    - `SeriesToolbar`
    - `DiscographyToolbar`
    - `Toast` / `TopNav`
    - **Why?** To ensure the "Premium" feel (Principle I) isn't undermined by janky re-renders or security flaws.

### 🏗️ Architecture
4.  **Enforce Component Standard**: Create a strict `BaseComponent` class that ENFORCES `render()` returning an Element (via SafeDOM), not a string. Reject PRs that add `innerHTML`.

---

## 5. Conclusion

The "Brain" of the application (Search, Classification, Logic) is performing at a V9 level.
The "Body" (UI, Views, Components) is lagging at a V4 level, carrying legacy weight.
**Next Phase Focus**: **Frontend Hardening & Component Standardization**.

# Playlist Algorithm Menu

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-16  
**Sprint**: 8 - Algorithm Strategy Pattern  
**Status**: SPECIFICATION

---

## Algorithm Registry

| # | ID | Name | Status | Description |
|---|-----|------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | `legacy-roundrobin` | Legacy Round-Robin | ✅ Implemented | Current implementation (simplified) |
| 1 | `s-draft-original` | S-Draft Hybrid Curator Original | ✅ Implemented | Full Serpentine algorithm |
| 2 | `mjrp-balanced-cascade` | MJRP Balanced Cascade | ✅ Implemented | Serpentine + Cascade (recommended) |

---

## 0. Legacy Round-Robin

**ID**: `legacy-roundrobin`  
**Badge**: "LEGACY"  
**Status**: ✅ Currently Coded

### Description
> The current implementation in `CurationEngine.curate()`. A simplified version that uses round-robin distribution instead of full Serpentine.

### How It Works
1. **P1**: Rank #1 from each album
2. **P2**: Rank #2 from each album
3. **Deep Cuts**: Round-robin by album bucket (NOT Serpentine)

### Limitations
- ❌ Does NOT implement true Serpentine (odd/even album logic)
- ❌ No 30-min minimum enforcement
- ❌ Fixed 45-min target (hardcoded)

### Code Location
- `shared/curation.js` → `CurationEngine.curate()` (lines 253-384)

---

## 1. S-Draft Hybrid Curator Original

**ID**: `s-draft-original`  
**Badge**: "ORIGINAL"  
**Status**: 🔜 Planned

### Description
> The original MJRP algorithm design. Creates 2 Greatest Hits playlists + Deep Cuts with full Serpentine distribution.

### Rules of Thumb
| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Target duration | ~45 min per playlist |
| Flexibility | ±7 min |
| Coverage | All playlists must have tracks from all albums |
| Track usage | All tracks from all albums must be used |

### Algorithm Phases

#### FASE 1: Preparation & Ranking
- **N**: Number of albums to distribute
- **P**: Number of playlists (flexible based on duration)
- **Ranking**: Each album's tracks ranked #1 (most acclaimed) to #M (least)

#### FASE 2: Greatest Hits Extraction
| Playlist | Content |
|----------|---------|
| **P1** | Rank #1 from each album |
| **P2** | Rank #2 from each album |

#### FASE 3: Serpentine Distribution (P3 to P)
Remaining tracks (rank #3+) distributed using S-Draft:

**RULE A - Odd Albums (1, 3, 5...)**
```
Track #3 → Playlist P
Track #4 → Playlist P-1
Track #5 → Playlist P-2
...continue up to P3...
[TURN] → reverse direction
Track #X → Playlist 3
Track #X+1 → Playlist 4
...continue down...
```

**RULE B - Even Albums (2, 4, 6...)**
```
Track #3 → Playlist 3
Track #4 → Playlist 4
Track #5 → Playlist 5
...continue down to P...
[TURN] → reverse direction
Track #X → Playlist P
Track #X+1 → Playlist P-1
...continue up...
```

#### FASE 4: Duration Rebalancing
Manual swaps may be needed to achieve ~45 min ±7 min per playlist.

### Expected Output
```
📀 Greatest Hits Vol. 1 (~45 min)
   └─ Rank #1 from each album

📀 Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (~45 min)
   └─ Rank #2 from each album

📀 Deep Cuts Vol. 1-N (~45 min each)
   └─ Serpentine-balanced tracks
```

---

## 2. MJRP Balanced Cascade

**ID**: `mjrp-balanced-cascade`  
**Badge**: "RECOMMENDED"  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented (Sprint 8)

### Description
> Hybrid algorithm combining Serpentine distribution with Cascade rebalancing. Ensures balanced Deep Cuts with global overflow handling.

### Rules of Thumb
| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Greatest Hits max | **60 min** |
| Deep Cuts max | **48 min** (trim to Orphan Tracks) |
| Minimum any playlist | **30 min** |
| numDC formula | **minTracksInAnyAlbum - 2** |
| GH content | **ONLY rank #1 and #2** (never #3+) |
| Coverage | Conditional: applies if numDC ≤ minTracks |

### Algorithm Phases

#### FASE 1: Preparation & Ranking
- **N**: Number of albums
- **numDC**: minTracksInAnyAlbum - 2
- **Ranking**: Each album's tracks ranked #1 to #M

#### FASE 2: Greatest Hits Extraction

**Single Playlist (if #1+#2 ≤ 60 min)**:
- **P1**: Rank #1 AND rank #2 from each album

**Split into 2 Playlists (if #1+#2 > 60 min)**:
| Playlist | Content |
|----------|---------|
| **P1 (Vol. 1)** | ALL rank #1 tracks |
| **P2 (Vol. 2)** | ALL rank #2 tracks |

#### FASE 3a: Serpentine Distribution (First Pass)

Distribute tracks #3 to #(numDC+2):

| Album Type | Direction |
|------------|-----------|
| **Odd (1,3,5,7)** | DC_last → DC1 |
| **Even (2,4,6)** | DC1 → DC_last |

#### FASE 3b: Cascade Global (Excess Tracks)

When smallest album runs out, remaining albums continue with **global ping-pong by ranking**:

```
#(numDC+3) → DC_last (all albums that have it)
#(numDC+4) → DC_(last-1)
#(numDC+5) → DC_(last-2)
...continues ping-pong if needed...
```

#### FASE 4: Duration Trim

```
FOR each DC with duration > 48 min:
    WHILE duration > 48 min:
        Remove track with lowest ranking
        Move to "Orphan Tracks" playlist
```

### Expected Output

```
📀 Greatest Hits Vol. 1 (all #1s)
📀 Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (all #2s)
📀 Deep Cuts Vol. 1 (balanced by Serpentine)
📀 Deep Cuts Vol. 2 (balanced by Serpentine)
...
📀 Deep Cuts Vol. N (may include Cascade extras)
📀 Orphan Tracks (trimmed excess, if any)
```

# Implementation Plan: Algorithm Strategy Pattern

**Branch**: `feature/sprint8-algorithm-strategy` | **Date**: 2025-12-16 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `docs/technical/specs/algorithm-strategy/spec.md`

## Summary

Refactor the playlist generation system from a monolithic `CurationEngine.curate()` to a pluggable Strategy Pattern. Users will select an algorithm from a UI selector, and the system executes the corresponding strategy.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES6+ (Vanilla JS)  
**Primary Dependencies**: None (pure JS classes)  
**Storage**: N/A (algorithms are stateless)  
**Testing**: Vitest  
**Target Platform**: Web (SPA)  
**Project Type**: Single frontend project  
**Performance Goals**: Generation < 1 second for 10 albums  
**Constraints**: No external dependencies, maintain backward compatibility  
**Scale/Scope**: 3 algorithms, 1 UI selector, ~500 lines new code

## Constitution Check

✅ Single Responsibility: Each algorithm in separate file  
✅ Open/Closed: New algorithms don't modify existing code  
✅ Dependency Inversion: Views depend on BaseAlgorithm interface

# Feature Specification: Algorithm Strategy Pattern

**Feature Branch**: `feature/sprint8-algorithm-strategy`  
**Created**: 2025-12-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User requirement: "Modular algorithm selection for playlist generation"

## User Scenarios & Testing

> **IMPORTANT**: The generated playlist output (UI, drag&drop, displayed information) remains **exactly the same** as today. Only the generation engine (algorithm) changes.

### User Story 1 - Select Algorithm Before Generation (Priority: P1)

User navigates to the playlist generation screen/modal and sees a list of available algorithms with descriptions. They can select one before generating.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality - without algorithm selection, the feature has no value.

**Independent Test**: Open PlaylistsView, verify algorithm selector is visible, select an algorithm, and generate playlists.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on PlaylistsView, **When** they click "Generate Playlists", **Then** an algorithm selector is displayed
2. **Given** algorithm selector is visible, **When** user selects "S-Draft MJRP Balanced", **Then** the description updates to match
3. **Given** an algorithm is selected, **When** user clicks "Generate", **Then** playlists are created using that algorithm

---

### User Story 2 - Default to Recommended Algorithm (Priority: P1)

When user opens the generation UI, the recommended algorithm (S-Draft MJRP Balanced) is pre-selected.

**Why this priority**: Essential UX - new users shouldn't need to understand algorithms to get started.

**Independent Test**: Open generation UI, verify "S-Draft MJRP Balanced" is pre-selected with [RECOMMENDED] badge.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens generation modal, **When** modal loads, **Then** "S-Draft MJRP Balanced" is pre-selected
2. **Given** recommended algorithm is selected, **When** user generates immediately, **Then** playlists use the recommended algorithm

---

### User Story 3 - View Algorithm Descriptions (Priority: P2)

Each algorithm in the selector displays its name, badge, and a brief description explaining what it does.

**Why this priority**: Helps users make informed choices, but not blocking for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: View selector, verify each option shows name + badge + description.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** algorithm selector is open, **When** user views options, **Then** each shows name, badge (LEGACY/ORIGINAL/RECOMMENDED), and description
2. **Given** user hovers/focuses an algorithm, **When** reading description, **Then** it explains what playlists will be generated

---

### User Story 4 - Legacy Algorithm Available (Priority: P1)

Users can use the Legacy Round-Robin algorithm - the currently tested and working implementation.

**Why this priority**: Essential - this is the only algorithm that is currently tested and functionally working. Must be available as a baseline.

**Independent Test**: Select Legacy algorithm, generate, verify P1/P2/Deep Cuts structure as before.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user selects "Legacy Round-Robin", **When** they generate, **Then** output matches current behavior

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when 0 albums are loaded? → Show error toast
- What happens when algorithm fails? → Catch error, show message, keep UI responsive
- What happens with very short series (< 5 tracks)? → Algorithm handles gracefully

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

> **IMPORTANT**: Playlist output (UI, drag&drop, track display) remains unchanged.

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a registry of available algorithms
- **FR-002**: System MUST display algorithm selector in PlaylistsView before generation
- **FR-003**: System MUST show algorithm description when selected
- **FR-004**: System MUST execute the selected algorithm via a unified interface
- **FR-008**: Generated playlists MUST have the same structure/UI as today (no output changes)
- **FR-009**: Drag & drop editing MUST continue to work on generated playlists
- **FR-005**: System MUST default to "S-Draft MJRP Balanced" as recommended
- **FR-006**: Old inputs (playlistCount, minDuration, maxDuration) MUST be removed
- **FR-007**: All 3 algorithms (Legacy, Original, Balanced) MUST be available

### Key Entities

- **BaseAlgorithm**: Abstract base class defining generate() interface
- **AlgorithmRegistry**: Factory/registry for available algorithms
- **AlgorithmMetadata**: id, name, badge, description, isRecommended

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: User can generate playlists using any of the 3 algorithms
- **SC-002**: Default algorithm produces correct output per ALGORITHM_MENU.md spec
- **SC-003**: Build passes with no lint errors
- **SC-004**: Existing tests continue to pass (backward compatible)

# Implementation Plan: Sprint 17 - Architectural Modularization

**Branch**: `feature/sprint17-modularization`
**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Summary

This sprint focuses on **Frontend Specialization** to address the "Thick Client" technical debt. We will decompose three major monoliths (`SeriesView`, `MusicKitService`, `CurationEngine`) into modular Controllers and Services, and shift data patching logic to the Backend to clean up the data flow.

---

## User Story 1: SeriesView Refactor (The "Thin View" Pattern)

### Current Architecture vs Proposed
**Current**: `SeriesView.js` (500+ LOC) handles:
1.  UI Mounting/Rendering
2.  Orchestration (Filter updates, Search)
3.  Business Logic (`filterAlbums`, `getUniqueArtists`) - *Stateful*
4.  Event Handling (Card clicks)

**Proposed**: Decompose into MVP-like structure:

```mermaid
graph TD
    SC[SeriesController] --> SV[SeriesView]
    SC --> SFS[SeriesFilterService]
    
    SV -- Events --> SC
    SFS -- Returns Filtered Data --> SC
    SC -- Updates --> SV
```

### Components

#### 1. `SeriesFilterService.js` (NEW) (Logic Only)
- **Responsibility**: Pure function logic for filtering and sorting.
- **Methods**:
    - `filter(albums, criteria: { series, artist, year, source })`
    - `getUniqueArtists(albums)`
    - `getUniqueYears(albums)`
- **Dependencies**: None (Pure JS).

#### 2. `SeriesController.js` (Enhanced) (Orchestrator)
- **Responsibility**: Manages State (`currentFilter`, `searchQuery`), calls Service, updates View.
- **Methods**:
    - `handleFilterChange()`
    - `handleSearch()`
    - `refreshGrid()`

#### 3. `SeriesView.js` (Refactored) (Dumb UI)
- **Responsibility**: Mounting components, exposing DOM events.
- **Target Size**: < 200 LOC.

---

## User Story 2: MusicKitService Split

### Strategy
Break the 692 LOC file by domain. Keep `MusicKitService.js` as a **Facade** to maintain backward compatibility for consumers.

### File Structure
```text
services/musickit/
├── index.js           # Facade (exports singleton instance)
├── MusicKitAuth.js    # Auth, Token Management, Instance Setup
├── MusicKitCatalog.js # Search, Get Album Details (Public API)
└── MusicKitLibrary.js # Export Playlist, Get User Playlists (Private API)
```

---

## User Story 3: Curation Engine & Top N Parametrization

### Strategy Pattern Implementation
Refactor `CurationEngine` to delegate the "filling" logic to Strategy classes.

```javascript
// Interface
class CurationStrategy {
    generate(albums, opts) { /* returns playlists[] */ }
}
```

### Top N Parametrization (UI/UX)
**UI Mockup (Blending Menu)**:
```text
[ Flavor Card: Top N ] (Selected)
----------------------------------
Ingredients Panel:
[ Slider: Top N Tracks ]
1 ---[o]------ 10  (Value: 3)

[ Output Mode ] [ Discovery Mode ]
```

### Implementation Steps
1.  **Backend/Logic**: `TopNAlgorithm.js` already supports `opts.trackCount`. Ensure `CurationEngine` passes it through.
2.  **UI**: Update `BlendIngredientsPanel.js`:
    - Add `ALGORITHM_INGREDIENTS['top-n'].nValue = true` config.
    - Render Slider if `config.nValue` is true.
    - Pass `algorithmParams: { n: sliderValue }` to `PlaylistGenerationService`.

---

## User Story 4: Data Normalization (Backend)

### Data Flow Change
**Current**:
API -> `fetchRanking` -> Raw JSON -> Client -> `client.js` (Fix Thriller, Add Artist) -> UI

**Proposed**:
API -> `fetchRanking` -> `normalize.js` (Fix Thriller, Add Artist) -> JSON -> Client -> UI

### Changes
1.  Modify `server/lib/normalize.js`:
    - Ensure `spotifyId`, `bestEverScore` are present (or null).
    - Ensure `artist`, `title`, `series` are clean.
    - **CRITICAL**: Move the "Thriller" workaround (Query Object vs Array) here.
2.  Simplify `client.js`: Remove `fixAlbumData()` or equivalent patchers.

---

## Execution Order (Dependencies)

1.  **US 4 (Backend Normalization)**: Do this first. It simplifies the data objects used by US 1 and US 3.
2.  **US 1 (SeriesView)**: High impact, independent.
3.  **US 2 (MusicKit)**: Low risk refactor (mostly move file).
4.  **US 3 (Curation/Top N)**: Complex UI + Logic. Do last to ensure stable base.

# Feature Specification: Sprint 17 - Architectural Modularization (Frontend Specialization)

**Feature Branch**: `feature/sprint17-modularization`
**Created**: 2026-01-03
**Status**: Implemented
**Released**: 2026-01-04
**Input**: Roadmap Sprint 17 Goals, Code Quality Assessment v10.1

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - SeriesView Performance & Maintainability (Priority: P1)

As a Developer, I want `SeriesView` to be a "Thin View" (< 200 LOC) that only handles rendering, so that I can add new filtering/sorting logic without risking regression in the UI rendering code.

**Why this priority**: `SeriesView.js` has reached 500+ LOC ("God Class"). It mixes UI rendering, Event Handling, and complex Filtering logic, making it fragile and hard to test. This is the highest technical debt in the UI layer.

**Independent Test**:
- Navigate to `/albums`.
- Verify all filters (Series, Artist, Year, Source) work exactly as before.
- Verify "View Album" and "Edit Series" actions work exactly as before.
- **Code Metric**: `SeriesView.js` must be under 250 LOC.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the Albums View is loaded, **When** I switch Series or apply an Artist filter, **Then** the grid updates instantly and correctly (Testing `SeriesFilterService`).
2. **Given** I am browsing albums, **When** I click "Refresh" or "Toggle View", **Then** the UI interaction is handled by the Controller, not the View directly.

---

### User Story 2 - Resilient MusicKit Integration (Priority: P2)

As a Developer, I want `MusicKitService` split into distinctive Auth, Catalog, and Library services, so that authentication logic doesn't crash the search catalog feature and vice-versa.

**Why this priority**: `MusicKitService.js` is the largest single file in the project (692 LOC). It handles Auth (Token exchange), Catalog Search (Region-specific), and User Library (Playlists). A bug in Auth currently paralyzes Search.

**Independent Test**:
- Users can Search for albums (CatalogService) effectively.
- Users can Export playlists (LibraryService) effectively.
- **Code Metric**: `MusicKitService.js` (Orchestrator) under 150 LOC.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** I am not logged in to Apple Music, **When** I search for an album, **Then** it works using the public token (CatalogService).
2. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I export a playlist, **Then** it uses my user token (LibraryService/AuthService).

---

### User Story 3 - Curation Engine Extensibility & Top N Parametrization (Priority: P3)

As a Curator, I want the `CurationEngine` to use a clear Strategy Pattern for algorithms AND support variable Top N selection (1-10), so that the code is clean and I have more control over playlist density.

**Why this priority**: 
1. `curation.js` (518 LOC) contains implicit state machines (Technical Debt).
2. We currently rely on hardcoded subclasses like `Top3Algorithm` (Feature Limitation). Refactoring fixes both.

**UI/UX Impact (Holistic Analysis)**:
- **BlendingIngredientsPanel.js**:
    - MUST detect if the selected flavor is "parametrized" (e.g., `TopNAlgorithm`).
    - MUST conditionally render a new "Algorithm Parameters" section (e.g., Slider 1-10 for `nValue`).
    - MUST normalize this parameter in `getConfig()` (passed as `algorithmParams: { n: value }`).
- **Flavor Cards**: Replace static "Top 3" / "Top 5" cards with a single "Top N" card in the flavor selection step.

**Independent Test**:
- Generate playlists using "Balanced Cascade" (verifies Strategy Pattern).
- Generate playlists using "Top N" with N=1 (Singles) and N=7 (Deep Cuts) (verifies Parametrization).
- **Code Metric**: `CurationEngine.js` under 200 LOC.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** I select "Top 5 Popular", **When** I generate, **Then** the `TopNAlgorithm` strategy is executed cleanly.
2. **Given** the Blending Menu, **When** I select "Top N", **Then** I see a number input/slider (1-10).
3. **Given** I select N=4, **When** I generate, **Then** the playlist contains exactly the top 4 ranked tracks from each album.

---

### User Story 4 - Data Hygiene (Backend Normalization) (Priority: P4)

As a Developer, I want the Backend to return "Clean" normalized album objects, so that the Frontend doesn't need 500 lines of code to patch missing fields (e.g., "Thriller" bug, missing artwork).

**Why this priority**: The "Thick Client" report identified "Data Patching" as a major source of frontend bloat.

**Independent Test**:
- Fetch an album via API.
- Verify the JSON response *already* contains `spotifyId`, `bestEverScore` (if available), and correct `artist/title` without client-side fixes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** I fetch a known problematic album (e.g., with special characters), **When** the API responds, **Then** the data is structured correctly according to the V3 Schema.

---

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: `SeriesView` MUST delegate all non-rendering logic to `SeriesController` and `SeriesFilterService`.
- **FR-002**: `MusicKitService` MUST be refactored into `services/musickit/` directory with `Auth.js`, `Catalog.js`, `Library.js`.
- **FR-003**: `CurationEngine` MUST separate "Ranking Source" logic (fetching scores) from "Balancing Logic" (filling playlists).
- **FR-004**: Backend `normalize.js` MUST handle object structure validation previously done in `client.js`.

### Key Entities

- **SeriesFilterService**: New stateless service for filtering/sorting arrays of Albums.
- **RankingSourceRegistry**: Registry for 'BEA', 'Spotify', 'LastFM' score providers.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: `SeriesView.js` size reduced by >50% (Target: < 250 LOC).
- **SC-002**: `MusicKitService.js` size reduced by >70% (Target: < 200 LOC).
- **SC-003**: `curation.js` size reduced by >60% (Target: < 200 LOC).
- **SC-004**: No regression in E2E tests for Series browsing or Playlist Generation.

--------------------------------------------------
# Sprint 17 Review: Architecture & Features

**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Status:** Completed

## 1. Executive Summary
Sprint 17 focused on architectural modularization, frontend performance, and feature flexibility. The monolithic `MusicKitService` was decomposed, `SeriesView` was refactored into a passive view, and the "Variable Top N" feature was implemented using the Strategy Pattern. Additionally, a long-standing backend data normalization bug ("Thriller Bug") was resolved.

## 2. Key Achievements

### 2.1 Backend Data Normalization (Fixing "Thriller Bug")
- **Problem:** Albums with single-track results were occasionally treated as objects instead of arrays by the API, causing "filter is not a function" errors.
- **Solution:** Implemented `ensureArray` utility in `server/lib/normalize.js` and enforced normalization at the data ingress point.
- **Verification:** Verified via `test-normalize.js` with simulated malformed responses.

### 2.2 SeriesView Refactor ("Thin View")
- **Goal:** Reduce `SeriesView.js` complexity (was >400 LOC) and enforce unidirectional data flow.
- **Changes:**
    - Extracted filtering logic to `SeriesFilterService.js`.
    - Moved state management to `SeriesController.js`.
    - `SeriesView` now acts as a passive renderer, receiving state from the controller.
- **Result:** Improved maintainability and testability of the Series UI.

### 2.3 MusicKit Modularization
- **Goal:** Decompose the 700+ LOC `MusicKitService.js`.
- **Changes:**
    - Created `public/js/services/musickit/` directory.
    - `MusicKitAuth.js`: Handles initialization, tokens, and storefronts.
    - `MusicKitCatalog.js`: Handles search, album details, and discography.
    - `MusicKitLibrary.js`: Handles playlist creation and folder management.
    - `MusicKitService.js`: Re-implemented as a **Facade** delegating to these modules, preserving the existing API.

### 2.4 Curation Engine & Variable Top N
- **Goal:** Allow users to choose N (1-10) for "Top N" algorithms.
- **Changes:**
    - Validated `BaseAlgorithm` as the Strategy interface.
    - Updated `TopNAlgorithm.js` to respect `opts.trackCount` (N), overriding defaults.
    - Updated `PlaylistGenerationService.js` to propagate `trackCount` from config.
    - Updated `BlendIngredientsPanel.js` to include a "Tracks per Album" slider, conditionally shown for Top N flavors.
    - **Verification:** Verified via `test-top-n.js`.

## 3. Metrics & LOC Analysis
*Estimated changes based on code edits.*

| Component | Before (Approx) | After (Approx) | Status |
|-----------|----------------:|---------------:|--------|
| MusicKitService | 692 LOC | ~80 LOC | ✅ Modularized |
| SeriesView | ~400 LOC | ~200 LOC | ✅ Refactored |
| normalize.js | N/A | +20 LOC | ✅ Hardened |

## 4. Next Steps (Sprint 18)
- **Deep Testing:** Manual verification of the UI interactions.
- **Documentation:** Update `component_reference.md` (pending).
- **Deployment:** Deploy to staging for user acceptance testing.

## Approval Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Gate**: Cannot proceed to `tasks.md` until this Plan is APPROVED.

1. ✅ Logic flow makes sense?
2. ✅ UI mockup with counters approved?
3. ✅ Component strategy clear?

## 7. Sprint 17.75-B: Classification Unification (2026-01-06)

> [!NOTE]
> **Discovery during Implementation**: Holistic analysis revealed duplicate classification logic across 7 files.

### 7.1 Files Analyzed

| # | File | Lines | Purpose | Action |
|:--|:-----|:------|:--------|:-------|
| 1 | `MusicKitCatalog.js` | 185, 274-281 | Initial classification | **REMOVE** |
| 2 | `AlbumSearchService.js` | 138-143 | ARCH-18 source | ✅ CORRECT |
| 3 | `ArtistScanner.js` | 159-169 | Filter albums | **REFACTOR** |
| 4 | `DiscographyRenderer.js` | 37-39 | Display badges | **REFACTOR** |
| 5 | `PlaylistsExport.js` | 158 | Live detection for track search | ⏭️ SKIP |
| 6 | `EditionFilter.js` | 25, 47-52 | Edition filtering | ⏭️ SKIP |
| 7 | `ScoreCalculator.js` | 48-51, 61-63 | Scoring penalties | ⏭️ SKIP |

### 7.2 Why Skip 3 Files?

- **PlaylistsExport**: Track-level live detection during export (no album classification data)
- **EditionFilter**: Filters by EDITION (Deluxe, Remaster), not TYPE
- **ScoreCalculator**: Applies scoring penalties in fuzzy search context

### 7.3 Changes Required

#### MusicKitCatalog.js
- Delete `_classifyAlbumType()` method (lines 274-281)
- Delete `albumType: this._classifyAlbumType()` (line 185)

#### ArtistScanner.js
```diff
- const isSingle = album.isSingle || album.albumType === 'Single'
- const isLive = album.isLive || title.includes('(live')
- const isCompilation = album.isCompilation || title.includes('greatest hits')
- const isEP = album.albumType === 'EP'
+ const type = album.type || 'Uncategorized';
+ if (type === 'Album' && this.filterState.albums) return true;
+ if ((type === 'Single' || type === 'EP') && this.filterState.singles) return true;
+ if (type === 'Live' && this.filterState.live) return true;
+ if (type === 'Compilation' && this.filterState.compilations) return true;
```

#### DiscographyRenderer.js
```diff
- if (lowerTitle.includes('live') || album.isLive) badges.push('Live');
- if (album.isSingle) badges.push('Single');
- if (album.isCompilation) badges.push('Comp');
+ if (album.type === 'Live') badges.push('Live');
+ if (album.type === 'Single') badges.push('Single');
+ if (album.type === 'EP') badges.push('EP');
+ if (album.type === 'Compilation') badges.push('Comp');
```

### 7.4 Enhance AppleMetadataStrategy

Add native Apple API attributes:
- `albumType` (ep, single, compilation)
- `contentTraits` (includes 'live')

---

### 7.5 Hybrid AI Optimization (Cache + Lazy + Skip)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Problem**: AI is called for EVERY artist search, even when not needed.

#### Current Flow (Inefficient)
```
getArtistDiscography("Pink Floyd")
    ├── [PARALLEL] Apple Music API → rawAlbums[]
    └── [PARALLEL] AI Call → aiList[]        ← WASTED! Rock doesn't need AI
```

#### Proposed Hybrid Flow
```
getArtistDiscography("Ferry Corsten")
    │
    └── Apple Music API → rawAlbums[]
    │
    └── AlbumTypeClassifier.classify() for each album
            │
            ├── Etapa 1-4: Classify → some classified
            └── Etapa 5 (AIWhitelist):
                    │
                    ├── isElectronic()? NO → return 'Album' (NO AI!)
                    └── isElectronic()? YES
                            │
                            ├── Cache hit? → Use cached aiList
                            └── Cache miss? → LAZY fetch AI, cache result
```

#### Three Optimizations Combined

| # | Optimization | Implementation | Benefit |
|:--|:-------------|:---------------|:--------|
| 1 | **Cache** | `aiCache: Map<artistName, aiList>` | Avoid repeated calls for same artist |
| 2 | **Lazy** | AI called only when Etapa 5 needs it | Skip AI if earlier stages classify |
| 3 | **Skip** | `if (!isElectronic(genres)) return 'Album'` | Skip AI for non-electronic artists |

#### Estimated Savings

| Scenario | Current | Proposed |
|:---------|:--------|:---------|
| Pink Floyd (rock) | 1 AI call | **0 AI calls** |
| Ferry Corsten (1st search) | 1 AI call | 1 AI call |
| Ferry Corsten (2nd search) | 1 AI call | **0 AI calls** (cache) |
| Yes (prog rock) | 1 AI call | **0 AI calls** |
#### 7.5.3 Optimization Results
- **Non-Electronic (Pink Floyd)**: 0 AI calls (skipped entirely).
- **Electronic (Ferry Corsten)**: 1 AI call (first search), then 0 (cached).
- **Cache**: Persists for the session, reducing 15s wait to <3s.

### 7.6 Refinement: Genre Bifurcation (GenreGateStrategy)

To preventing non-electronic artists (e.g., Pink Floyd, Yes) from being incorrectly classified by electronic-specific strategies (like Track Count or AI Whitelist), we introduce a bifurcation step.

#### 7.6.1 Logic Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Album Input] --> B[AppleMetadataStrategy]
    B -->|Classified| END[Return Type]
    B -->|Next| C[TitleKeywordStrategy]
    C -->|Classified| END
    C -->|Next| D[GenreGateStrategy] <--- NEW STEP 2.5
    
    D -->|Non-Electronic| E[Return 'Album']
    D -->|Electronic| F[RemixTracksStrategy]
    
    F -->|Classified| END
    F -->|Next| G[TrackCountStrategy]
    G -->|Classified| END
    G -->|Next| H[AIWhitelistStrategy]
    H -->|Match| END
    H -->|No Match| I[Uncategorized]
```

#### 7.6.2 GenreGateStrategy Implementation
- **Role**: Validates if the artist needs further heuristic processing.
- **Logic**:
  - If **Non-Electronic**: Returns `'Album'` immediately (Trusts Apple API/Metadata for Rock, Pop, Jazz, etc.).
  - If **Electronic**: Returns `null` (Passes through to Remix, EPs, and AI checks).

#### Code Changes

**AlbumSearchService.js**:
```javascript
constructor() {
    // ... existing
    this.aiCache = new Map(); // NEW: Cache for AI responses
}

async getArtistDiscography(artistName) {
    const rawAlbums = await musicKitService.getArtistAlbums(normalizedArtist);
    
    // Pass lazy fetcher instead of eagerly fetching AI
    const context = {
        getAiList: () => this._fetchAIWithCache(normalizedArtist)
    };
    
    return this._processDiscography(rawAlbums, context);
}

async _fetchAIWithCache(artistName) {
    if (this.aiCache.has(artistName)) {
        console.log(`[AI] Cache hit for "${artistName}"`);
        return this.aiCache.get(artistName);
    }
    
    const aiList = await this._fetchAIStudioAlbums(artistName);
    this.aiCache.set(artistName, aiList);
    return aiList;
}
```

**AIWhitelistStrategy.js**:
```javascript
async execute(album, context) {
    const genres = context.genres || [];
    
    // Skip AI for non-electronic
    if (!isElectronic(genres) && trackCount >= 7) {
        this.log(album.title, 'Album', 'non-electronic, 7+ tracks');
        return 'Album';
    }
    
    // Lazy AI call (only if electronic)
    if (isElectronic(genres)) {
        const aiList = await context.getAiList(); // Lazy!
        // ... check whitelist
    }
    
    return null;
}
```

### 7.7 Refinement: AI Feedback Loop (Scorecard Pattern) [Sprint 17.75-C]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Problem**: "First Strategy Wins" logic is too rigid. Heuristics like `RemixTracksStrategy` can incorrectly classify Studio Albums as EPs/Singles, preventing the AI from validating them.
> **Solution**: Implement a **Feedback Loop / Override Pattern**.

#### 7.7.1 Revised Logic Flow
For Electronic Music, the AI Whitelist acts as a **Supreme Court** with veto power.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Album Input] --> B{Is Electronic?}
    
    B -->|No| C[Run Standard Heuristics]
    C --> D[Result: Album/EP/Single]
    D --> E[Final Result]
    
    B -->|Yes| F[Run Heuristics (Scorecard)]
    F --> G[Preliminary: EP (e.g., Remixes detected)]
    G --> H{Check AI Whitelist}
    
    H -->|In List| I[OVERRIDE: Studio Album]
    H -->|Not in List| J[CONFIRM: EP/Uncategorized]
```

#### 7.7.2 Implementation Details
1. **`AlbumTypeClassifier.js`**:
   - Change loop to capture `preliminaryResult`.
   - If `preliminaryResult` is found BUT genre is Electronic:
     - DO NOT RETURN yet.
     - Call `AIWhitelistStrategy.validate(album, preliminaryResult)`.
   - `AIWhitelistStrategy` determines if it should override the preliminary result.

2. **`AIWhitelistStrategy.js`**:
   - Add `validate(album, currentType)` method.
   - If `currentType` is 'EP' or 'Single' or 'Compilation' AND album is in AI List → Return 'Album'.
   - If `currentType` is 'Album' AND album is NOT in AI List → Return 'Uncategorized' (or keep as is if confident).

### 7.8 Sprint 17.75-C: Tasks
1. Refactor `AlbumTypeClassifier` to support override logic.
2. Update `AIWhitelistStrategy` to handle validation/override.
3. Verify Tiesto (Kaleidoscope) is rescued from "EP" to "Album".

### 7.9 Refinement: Type Sanity Check (Post-Processing)

To improve architecture and SRP, we are extracting ad-hoc heuristic checks from `AIWhitelistStrategy` into a dedicated post-processing step.

#### 7.9.1 Logic Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AIWhitelistStrategy] -->|Returns Type| B{TypeSanityCheck}
    B -->|Type=Album + Title has 'EP'| C[Downgrade to EP]
    B -->|Type=Album + Title has 'Single'| D[Downgrade to Single]
    B -->|Otherwise| E[Keep Original Type]
```

#### 7.9.2 Implementation Details
- **Component**: `TypeSanityCheckStrategy`
- **Role**: Final verification of the classification.
- **Rules**:
  - If type is `Album` but title contains `EP`, `Vol.`, `Pt.`, `Part` (without matching context) -> Downgrade.
  - This removes the "patchy" logic from the AI Strategy.

### Implementation Plan - AI Client Upgrade & Whitelist Refinement
Goal
Update 
aiClient.js
 to use a modern Gemini model (Gemini 2.5 Flash) that correctly identifies recent albums (e.g., "Connect") and ensure reliability of the whitelist mechanism by preventing response truncation and parsing errors.

Completed Changes
server/lib/aiClient.js
Model: Switched to models/gemini-2.5-flash.
Grounding: Enabled tools: [{ google_search: {} }] to ensure fresh data access.
AI Whitelist Strategy Refinement
Normalization Fix: Logic updated to handle titles with symbols/Morse code (e.g. ".----") by ignoring fuzzy keys that normalize to empty or very short strings (< 2 chars).
Safe Rescue Expansion: "Rescue" logic now explicitly blocks overrides if the album title contains keywords like "Presents", "Volume", "Compilation", "Collection", or "Anthology" unless the whitelisted title also contains them.
Token-Based Fuzzy Matching: Replaced loose includes() substring check with strict token matching. "Album Title" must match exact tokens in the whitelist. This prevents "Anyone" matching "One" or "Fireisland" matching "Island".
Goal: Prevent "Solarstone Presents Pure Trance" (Compilation) from being rescued to "Pure" (Studio Album) via fuzzy matching.
server/routes/ai.js
Max Tokens: Increased from 2000 to 10000. This fixes the critical bug where the JSON response was being cut off mid-stream, causing parsing errors and missing valid albums.
Parsing Logic: REPLACED fragile split-based fallback with a Robust Regex Extraction (/"([^"]+)"/g). This ensures that even if the JSON is slightly malformed or fails to parse, we extract every valid string between double quotes, eliminating "garbage" parsing results like '"Album",'.
Prompt: Updated to strictly exclude holiday/Christmas albums, preventing "Santa's X-Mas Dance Party" clutter.
public/js/services/album-search/classification/ElectronicGenreDetector.js
Localization Fix: Added eletrônica and electrónica.
Architectural Refactoring: Type Sanity Check Strategy (Post-Processing)
Goal: Extract "patchy" heuristic logic (e.g. downgrading "Albums" that contain 'EP' in the title) from 
AIWhitelistStrategy
 into a dedicated post-processing step to adhere to SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
Component: TypeSanityCheckStrategy (New Class)
Logic:
Runs AFTER AI Whitelist Strategy.
Inspects the final proposed classification.
Downgrade Logic: If Type is 'Album' BUT title contains 'EP', 'Single', 'Sampler', etc. -> Downgrade to 'EP' or 'Compilation'.
Safety: Ensures that even if the AI or Heuristics say "Album", we have a final sanity check based on strong title keywords.
Benefit: Keeps 
AIWhitelistStrategy
 focused only on Whitelist matching and 
AlbumTypeClassifier
 focused on coordination.
Automated: 
test_ai_models.js
 confirms Gemini 2.5 + Search finds 2024 albums.
Manual: User to clear cache and re-scan. Results should be free of malformed strings and holiday garbage, improving signal-to-noise ratio significantly.

## Filtros UI

```
[Studio (X)] [Singles/EP (Y)] [Compilations (Z)] [Live (W)] [Uncategorized (N)]
```

---

## ETAPA 1: AppleMetadataStrategy (FONTE PRIMÁRIA INICIAL)

**Objetivo**: Usar flags oficiais da Apple Music API como fonte **primária e inicial** de classificação.

| Condição | Classificação |
|:---------|:--------------|
| `attributes.isSingle === true` | **Single** |
| `attributes.isCompilation === true` | **Compilation** |
| Nenhum flag → **Passa para próxima etapa** | |

---

## ETAPA 2: TitleKeywordStrategy

**Objetivo**: Classificar por patterns explícitos no título.

| Categoria | Patterns |
|:----------|:---------|
| **LIVE** | `(live)`, `live at`, `live from`, `unplugged`, `in concert`, `tour edition` |
| **DJ MIX** → Compilation | `(dj mix)`, `mixed by`, `continuous mix`, `megamix`, `ministry of sound`, regex: `(group therapy\|asot)\s*\d+` |
| **SINGLE** (explícito) | `- single`, `(single)`, `[single]` |
| **EP** (explícito) | `- ep`, `(ep)`, `[ep]` |
| **REMIX ALBUM** → Compilation | `remixes`, `remixed`, `the remixes` |
| **GREATEST HITS** → Compilation | `best of`, `greatest hits`, `anthology`, `essential` |
| **SOUNDTRACK** → Compilation | `soundtrack`, `ost`, `motion picture` |

---

## ETAPA 3: RemixTracksStrategy

**Objetivo**: Detectar singles/EPs com múltiplos remixes analisando os **nomes das tracks**.

### Heurística

```
SE (número de tracks com "remix", "mix", "version", "edit" no título >= 50% do total):
    SE (trackCount <= 6):
        → SINGLE
    SENÃO:
        → EP (remix package)
```

### Exemplos

| Release | Tracks | Track Titles | Resultado |
|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:----------|
| Connect | 15 | "Connect", "Connect (Extended Mix)", "Connect (Club Mix)", "Connect (Radio Edit)", ... | 80% remixes → **EP** |
| Blueprint | 12 | "Venera", "Piece of You", "Trust", ... (títulos únicos) | 0% remixes → **Passa** |

---

## ETAPA 4: TrackCountStrategy (COM PROTEÇÃO PROG ROCK)

**Objetivo**: Classificar por contagem de tracks **E duração** (protegendo álbuns com poucos tracks longos).

### Regras

| Condição | Classificação |
|:---------|:--------------|
| 1-3 tracks **E** duração total < 20 min | **Single** |
| 4-6 tracks **E** duração total < 30 min | **EP** |
| **Prog Rock/Art Rock** + duração >= 35 min + 3+ tracks | **Passa para próxima** (não é EP) |
| 7+ tracks | **Passa para próxima** |

### Proteção Prog Rock

Gêneros protegidos: `progressive rock`, `art rock`, `prog rock`, `progressive metal`, `post-rock`, `krautrock`

**Exemplo**: Yes - "Close to the Edge" (3 tracks, 38 min) → NÃO é EP, passa para próxima etapa.

---

## ETAPA 5: AIWhitelistStrategy (APENAS ELETRÔNICA)

**Objetivo**: Para releases de música eletrônica que chegaram até aqui (7+ tracks), usar AI como última confirmação.

### Aplicação

| Gênero | Comportamento |
|:-------|:--------------|
| **Eletrônica** (house, techno, trance, etc.) | AI whitelist decide: match → **Studio**, senão → **Uncategorized** |
| **Pop/Rock/Jazz/Classical tradicional** | 7+ tracks = **Studio Album** (sem AI, classificação direta) |

---

## 🔮 FUTURE ENHANCEMENT: EraCheckStrategy

> [!NOTE]
> **REMOVIDO DO ESCOPO ATUAL** - Requer pesquisa aprofundada antes de implementar.

### Contexto

Releases anteriores a ~1965 (era pré-LP) e 1965-1970 (era de transição) podem ter classificação ambígua. Artistas como James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Beatles iniciais lançavam principalmente singles.

### Considerações para Pesquisa Futura

- Quando exatamente o formato "álbum" se tornou padrão para cada gênero?
- Álbuns clássicos como Miles Davis "Kind of Blue" (1959), Beatles "Sgt. Pepper's" (1967) devem ser protegidos
- Gêneros como Jazz e Classical têm história diferente de Rock/Pop
- Precisamos de dados concretos antes de criar heurísticas

### Status
**Backlog**: Será pesquisado e implementado em sprint futuro após coleta de dados históricos.

| SC-003 | Singles com remixes detectados pelo RemixTracksStrategy |
| SC-004 | Yes - Close to the Edge NÃO classificado como EP |
| SC-005 | Pre-1965 releases vão para Uncategorized |
| SC-006 | Contadores visíveis em cada filtro |

---

## Arquitetura e Padrões de Design

### Alinhamento com a Constituição do Projeto

Esta implementação segue os princípios definidos em `docs/CONSTITUTION.md`:

| Princípio | Como é Aplicado |
|:----------|:----------------|
| **II. Clean Code & Modular Architecture** | Cada estratégia é um módulo independente com responsabilidade única |
| **Service Layer** | `AlbumTypeClassifier` é um serviço que encapsula a lógica de classificação |
| **Separation of Concerns** | Classificação separada de Search, Scoring, e Filtering |

---

### Padrões Arquiteturais Utilizados

#### 1. Chain of Responsibility (Funil)

O `AlbumTypeClassifier` implementa um **pipeline** onde cada estratégia processa o release e decide se classifica ou passa para a próxima etapa.

```javascript
// AlbumTypeClassifier.js - Orquestrador do Funil
export class AlbumTypeClassifier {
    constructor() {
        // Ordem das strategies = ordem do funil
        this.pipeline = [
            new AppleMetadataStrategy(),      // Etapa 1
            new TitleKeywordStrategy(),       // Etapa 2
            new RemixTracksStrategy(),        // Etapa 3
            new TrackCountStrategy(),         // Etapa 4
            new AIWhitelistStrategy()         // Etapa 5
        ];
    }

    classify(album, context) {
        for (const strategy of this.pipeline) {
            const result = strategy.execute(album, context);
            if (result !== null) {
                return result; // Classificado! Sai do funil
            }
            // result === null → passa para próxima
        }
        return 'Uncategorized'; // Nenhuma strategy classificou
    }
}
```

#### 2. Strategy Pattern (Estratégias Intercambiáveis)

Cada etapa do funil é uma **Strategy** que implementa a mesma interface:

```javascript
// classification/BaseStrategy.js
export class BaseStrategy {
    /** Nome para logging */
    name = 'BaseStrategy';
    
    /**
     * Tenta classificar o release
     * @param {Object} album - Dados do álbum
     * @param {Object} context - Contexto com AI list, gêneros, etc.
     * @returns {string|null} - Tipo classificado ou null para passar adiante
     */
    execute(album, context) {
        throw new Error('Subclass must implement execute()');
    }
}
```

**Benefícios**:
- Adicionar nova estratégia = criar novo arquivo, registrar no pipeline
- Remover estratégia = remover do pipeline
- Reordenar = mudar ordem no array
- Testar = mock album + context, verificar output

#### 3. Barrel Exports (Index.js)

Seguindo o padrão já usado em `views/*/index.js`:

```javascript
// classification/index.js
export { AppleMetadataStrategy } from './AppleMetadataStrategy.js';
export { TitleKeywordStrategy } from './TitleKeywordStrategy.js';
export { RemixTracksStrategy } from './RemixTracksStrategy.js';
export { TrackCountStrategy } from './TrackCountStrategy.js';
export { AIWhitelistStrategy } from './AIWhitelistStrategy.js';
export { ElectronicGenreDetector } from './ElectronicGenreDetector.js';
```

---

### Integração com AlbumSearchService

O `AlbumSearchService` atualmente tem o método `_classifyWithAI()` inline. Após refatoração:

```javascript
// AlbumSearchService.js (ANTES)
class AlbumSearchService {
    _classifyWithAI(album, aiList) {
        // ~100 linhas de lógica inline 😱
    }
}

// AlbumSearchService.js (DEPOIS)
import { albumTypeClassifier } from './AlbumTypeClassifier.js';

class AlbumSearchService {
    _processDiscography(albums, aiList = []) {
        const context = { aiList }; // Contexto compartilhado
        
        return albums.map(album => ({
            ...album,
            type: albumTypeClassifier.classify(album, context),
            // ...
        }));
    }
    
    // _classifyWithAI() REMOVIDO - toda lógica agora em strategies
}
```

---

### Testabilidade

Cada strategy pode ser testada isoladamente:

```javascript
// __tests__/TitleKeywordStrategy.test.js
import { TitleKeywordStrategy } from '../classification/TitleKeywordStrategy.js';

describe('TitleKeywordStrategy', () => {
    const strategy = new TitleKeywordStrategy();

    test('classifica live albums', () => {
        const album = { title: 'Live at Madison Square Garden' };
        expect(strategy.execute(album, {})).toBe('Live');
    });

    test('passa adiante se não encontrar keyword', () => {
        const album = { title: 'Blueprint' };
        expect(strategy.execute(album, {})).toBeNull();
    });
});
```

---

### Extensibilidade Futura

Para adicionar `EraCheckStrategy` futuramente:

1. Criar `classification/EraCheckStrategy.js`
2. Registrar no pipeline em `AlbumTypeClassifier.js`:
   ```javascript
   this.pipeline = [
       new AppleMetadataStrategy(),
       new TitleKeywordStrategy(),
       new RemixTracksStrategy(),
       new TrackCountStrategy(),
       new EraCheckStrategy(),     // 🆕 Inserir aqui
       new AIWhitelistStrategy()
   ];
   ```
3. Nenhum outro arquivo precisa mudar!

---

## 🍎 Apple Music API: Atributos de Álbum para Classificação

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DESCOBERTA (2026-01-06)**: A Apple Music API fornece atributos nativos que **não estavam sendo utilizados** no projeto. Esta seção documenta todos os atributos disponíveis para referência retroativa.

### Atributos Booleanos Nativos

| Atributo | Tipo | Descrição | Status no Projeto |
|:---------|:-----|:----------|:------------------|
| `isSingle` | `boolean` | Indica se consiste de uma única música | ✅ Usado na Etapa 1 |
| `isCompilation` | `boolean` | Indica se é uma coletânea | ✅ Usado na Etapa 1 |
| `isComplete` | `boolean` | Se todas as faixas estão disponíveis na região | ❌ Não usado |
| `isMasteredForItunes` | `boolean` | Se foi masterizado para Apple Digital Master | ❌ Não relevante |

### Atributos de Tipagem Nativa (NÃO UTILIZADOS)

| Atributo | Tipo | Valores Possíveis | Status |
|:---------|:-----|:------------------|:-------|
| `albumType` | `string` | `standard`, `single`, `deluxe`, `compilation`, **`ep`** | ⚠️ **NÃO USADO** - API fornece EP nativamente! |
| `contentTraits` | `string[]` | Array que pode incluir `live` | ⚠️ **NÃO USADO** - API pode indicar Live! |

### Outros Atributos Úteis

| Atributo | Tipo | Uso Potencial |
|:---------|:-----|:--------------|
| `trackCount` | `number` | ✅ Usado na Etapa 4 (TrackCountStrategy) |
| `genreNames` | `string[]` | ✅ Usado para detectar música eletrônica |
| `releaseDate` | `string` | Pode ajudar EraCheckStrategy futuro |
| `recordLabel` | `string` | Não usado atualmente |
| `audioVariants` | `string[]` | `dolby-atmos`, `hi-res-lossless`, etc. - Não relevante |

### Atributos Estendidos (Requerem `extend` parameter)

- `artistUrl` - URL do artista
- `audioVariants` - Qualidade de áudio disponível

### Recomendação

A `AppleMetadataStrategy` (Etapa 1) deve ser estendida para verificar:

```javascript
// PROPOSTA: AppleMetadataStrategy melhorada
execute(album, context) {
    const attrs = album.raw?.attributes || album;
    
    // 1. Check native albumType (NOVO!)
    if (attrs.albumType === 'ep') return 'EP';
    if (attrs.albumType === 'single') return 'Single';
    if (attrs.albumType === 'compilation') return 'Compilation';
    
    // 2. Check contentTraits for Live (NOVO!)
    if (attrs.contentTraits?.includes('live')) return 'Live';
    
    // 3. Fallback to boolean flags (existente)
    if (attrs.isSingle === true) return 'Single';
    if (attrs.isCompilation === true) return 'Compilation';
    
    return null;
}
```

## 🔍 Análise de Impacto Holístico: Unificação da Classificação

> [!CAUTION]
> **DESCOBERTA (2026-01-06)**: Existem **7 arquivos** com lógica de classificação duplicada/dispersa que precisam ser unificados para usar `album.type` do ARCH-18.

### Arquivos com Lógica de Classificação

| Arquivo | Linhas | Problema | Ação Necessária |
|:--------|:-------|:---------|:----------------|
| `MusicKitCatalog.js` | 274-281 | `_classifyAlbumType()` duplica lógica | **REMOVER** - centralizar no ARCH-18 |
| `ArtistScanner.js` | 159-169 | Lógica inline duplicada usando `albumType` | **REFATORAR** - usar `album.type` |
| `DiscographyRenderer.js` | 37-39 | Usa `isLive`, `isSingle`, `isCompilation` | **REFATORAR** - usar `album.type` |
| `PlaylistsExport.js` | 158 | `isLiveAlbum` baseado em título | Avaliar se precisa mudança |
| `EditionFilter.js` | 47, 51 | `isLive()`, `isCompilation()` methods | Avaliar se são necessários |
| `ScoreCalculator.js` | 48-61 | `_isLive()` para penalidades | Manter - contexto diferente (scoring) |
| `AlbumSearchService.js` | 140-142 | Cria flags `isSingle`, `isCompilation`, `isLive` | ✅ Correto - backward compatibility |

## Sprint 17.75-B: Tarefas de Unificação (PROPOSTA)

> [!WARNING]
> **ESCOPO ADICIONAL**: Para completar a arquitetura limpa, os seguintes arquivos precisam ser refatorados.

### Fase A: Remover Duplicação

1. **`MusicKitCatalog.js`**
   - Remover `_classifyAlbumType()` (linhas 274-281)
   - Remover `albumType: this._classifyAlbumType()` (linha 185)
   - Manter `raw: album` para passar dados à classificação

2. **`ArtistScanner.js`**
   - Refatorar `applyFilters()` (linhas 154-170)
   - Usar `album.type` em vez de `album.albumType`
   - Adicionar suporte a EP e Uncategorized filters

3. **`DiscographyRenderer.js`**
   - Refatorar `getBadges()` (linhas 37-39)
   - Usar `album.type` para determinar badges

### Fase B: Melhorar AppleMetadataStrategy

4. **`AppleMetadataStrategy.js`**
   - Adicionar verificação de `albumType` nativo (ep, single, compilation)
   - Adicionar verificação de `contentTraits` para Live
   - Manter fallback para `isSingle`/`isCompilation` booleans

### Verificação

- Testar Ferry Corsten: 8 Studio, 31 EPs, 105 Singles, 1 Live, 186 Compilations
- Testar Yes: "Close to the Edge" não deve ser EP
- Verificar `ArtistScanner` na view de Series mostra contagens corretas

--------------------------------------------------
# UX/UI Review: Data Migration Banner

**Date**: 2025-12-03
**Component**: `HomeView.js` (Migration Banner)
**Theme**: Nebula (Dark Mode, Glassmorphism, Flame/Amber Accents)

---

## 🔍 Analysis of Current Design

Based on the screenshot and code review:

1.  **Theme Violation (Critical)** 🔴
    *   **Current**: Solid Blue background (`bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-900...`).
    *   **Issue**: The "Blue" palette is foreign to the "Nebula" theme, which relies on **Deep Slate**, **Black**, and **Flame/Amber** gradients. It looks like a default Bootstrap alert.
    *   **Impact**: Breaks immersion and feels "cheap" compared to the Hero section.

2.  **Missing Icon** ⚠️
    *   **Current**: A placeholder circle appears in the screenshot.
    *   **Issue**: The `Database` icon is missing from `Icons.js`.
    *   **Impact**: Visual confusion.

3.  **Visual Hierarchy**
    *   **Current**: High contrast blue block competes with the Hero banner.
    *   **Goal**: Should be noticeable but integrated (Premium Notification).

---

## 🎨 Proposed Design: "Nebula Notification"

We will transform the banner into a **Glassmorphic Feature Card** that fits the app's premium aesthetic.

### Design Tokens
*   **Background**: Dark Glass (`bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-md`)
*   **Border**: Left accent border (`border-l-4 border-accent-primary`)
*   **Icon**: Amber/Orange gradient (`text-accent-primary`)
*   **Typography**: White title, Muted description.

### Preview (Conceptual)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Data Migration Available**
> We found data from a previous version... [Start Migration >]

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### 1. Add Missing Icon (`Icons.js`)
Add the `Database` icon to the registry.

```javascript
Database: `<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><ellipse cx="12" cy="5" rx="9" ry="3"/><path d="M21 12c0 1.66-4 3-9 3s-9-1.34-9-3"/><path d="M3 5v14c0 1.66 4 3 9 3s9-1.34 9-3V5"/></svg>`,
```

### 2. Update Banner Styling (`HomeView.js`)

**From**:
```html
<div class="migration-banner bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-900 to-indigo-900 border border-blue-500/30 ...">
```

**To**:
```html
<div class="migration-banner glass-panel p-6 mb-8 flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center justify-between gap-6 border-l-4 border-accent-primary relative overflow-hidden group">
  <!-- Dynamic Background Glow -->
  <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500/10 to-transparent opacity-50"></div>

# UI Consistency Audit Report - Production (v2.0.4)

**Date**: 2025-12-02  
**Auditor**: UX/UI Agent (Antigravity)  
**Scope**: Design System Consistency (Spacing, Typography, Layout)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Identificadas **3 inconsistências críticas de design** entre AlbumsView e PlaylistsView que quebram a coesão visual da aplicação. Todas podem ser corrigidas com padronização de classes Tailwind.

**Impacto**: Médio (Afeta percepção de qualidade)  
**Esforço**: Baixo (< 30min de implementação)

---

## 🔍 Inconsistências Identificadas

### 1. **Breadcrumb → Section Title Spacing** (CRÍTICO)

**Problema**: Espaçamento inconsistente entre breadcrumb e título da seção.

| View | Breadcrumb Wrapper | Title Wrapper | Spacing After Breadcrumb |
|------|-------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **AlbumsView** | `<header class="view-header mb-8">` | `<div class="header-title-row mb-6">` | **mb-6** (1.5rem) |
| **PlaylistsView** | `<header class="view-header mb-8">` | `<div class="header-content flex ... gap-4 mb-6">` | **gap-4** (1rem) |

**Análise**:
- AlbumsView usa `mb-6` (24px) entre breadcrumb e título
- PlaylistsView usa estrutura diferente com `flex` e `gap-4` (16px), resultando em espaçamento visual menor

**Localização**:
- **AlbumsView.js**: Linha 74 (`header-title-row`)
- **PlaylistsView.js**: Linha 44 (`header-content`)

**Recomendação**: Padronizar em `mb-6` após o breadcrumb em ambas as views.

```diff
# PlaylistsView.js (Linha 44)
- <div class="header-content flex flex-col md:flex-row justify-between items-start md:items-center gap-4 mb-6">
+ <div class="header-content mt-6 flex flex-col md:flex-row justify-between items-start md:items-center gap-4 mb-6">
```

---

### 2. **Section Title Styling** (ALTO IMPACTO)

**Problema**: Títulos de seção têm estilos completamente diferentes.

| View | Title Classes | Icon Size | Visual Weight |
|------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| **AlbumsView** | `text-4xl font-bold` | `w-8 h-8` | **4xl / Bold** |
| **PlaylistsView** | (nenhuma classe) | `w-8 h-8` | **Base / Regular** |

**Localização**:
- **AlbumsView.js**: Linha 75
```html
<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold flex items-center gap-3">
```

- **PlaylistsView.js**: Linha 45
```html
<h1 class="flex items-center gap-3">
```

**Problema Visual**: 
- AlbumsView: Título **grande e destacado** (text-4xl)
- PlaylistsView: Título **pequeno** (text-base, padrão do browser)

**Recomendação**: Aplicar as mesmas classes em PlaylistsView.

```diff
# PlaylistsView.js (Linha 45)
- <h1 class="flex items-center gap-3">
+ <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold flex items-center gap-3">
```

---

### 3. **Export Section Layout** (INCONSISTÊNCIA ESTRUTURAL)

**Problema**: Seção de Export não segue o Design System.

**Localização**: PlaylistsView.js, linhas 255-272

**Problemas Identificados**:

#### 3.1. Título sem classes
```html
<h3>Export Playlists</h3>  <!-- ❌ Sem estilo -->
```

**Deve ser**:
```html
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Export Playlists</h3>
```

#### 3.2. Container sem "glass-panel"
```html
<div class="export-section">  <!-- ❌ Sem estilo glass -->
```

**Deve ser**:
```html
<div class="export-section glass-panel p-8 text-center">
```

#### 3.3. Botões usando Emojis (VIOLA DESIGN SYSTEM)
```html
🎵 Export to Spotify  <!-- ❌ PROIBIDO: NO EMOJIS RULE -->
🍎 Export to Apple Music
💾 Download JSON
```

**Deve usar SVG Icons** (conforme `docs/onboarding/UX_UI.md` linha 14):
```javascript
${getIcon('Spotify', 'w-5 h-5')} Export to Spotify
${getIcon('Apple', 'w-5 h-5')} Export to Apple Music  
${getIcon('Download', 'w-5 h-5')} Download JSON
```

#### 3.4. Container de ações sem classes
```html
<div class="export-actions">  <!-- ❌ Sem espaçamento/layout -->
```

**Deve ser**:
```html
<div class="export-actions flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-4 mt-6">
```

## 🎨 Design Tokens - Padrão Recomendado

Para futuras implementações, usar:

### Headers de View
```html
<header class="view-header mb-8">
  ${Breadcrumb.render('/route')}
  <div class="header-title-row mt-6 mb-6">  <!-- Espaçamento padronizado -->
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold flex items-center gap-3">  <!-- Título consistente -->
      ${getIcon('IconName', 'w-8 h-8')} Title
    </h1>
  </div>
</header>
```

### Section Cards
```html
<div class="glass-panel p-8 text-center">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Section Title</h3>
  <div class="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-4">
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Buttons
- **Primary**: `btn btn-primary` + SVG Icon
- **Secondary**: `btn btn-secondary` + SVG Icon
- **❌ NUNCA usar emojis** (Regra do Design System)

---

## ✅ Critérios de Aceitação

- [ ] Breadcrumb tem `mt-6` em todas as views (AlbumsView, PlaylistsView, RankingView, InventoryView)
- [ ] Todos os `<h1>` usam `text-4xl font-bold`
- [ ] Export section usa `glass-panel p-8`
- [ ] Todos os botões usam SVG icons (zero emojis)
- [ ] Spacing vertical consistente (mb-6 entre elementos principais)

---

**Prioridade**: ALTA (Afeta produção)  
**Risco**: BAIXO (Mudanças apenas de estilo, sem lógica)

# Sprint 16 Implementation Plan: Modal Modernization

**Feature**: Legacy Modal Eradication & DialogService Implementation
**Status**: Planning
**Author**: Antigravity (AI Agent)

---

## 📅 Goal Description
The objective is to eliminate the legacy `Modals.js` file (17KB, 6 innerHTML sinks) and modernize the application's modal architecture. We will introduce a centralized `DialogService` built on top of the existing safe `BaseModal` and `SafeDOM`, and refactor `Toast.js` to remove its innerHTML usage.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 1. DialogService (`public/js/services/DialogService.js`)
A singleton service that abstracts the creation and management of standard user interactions.
- **Methods**:
  - `confirm(options)`: Shows a confirmation dialog (returns Promise).
  - `prompt(options)`: Shows a single-input dialog (returns Promise with value).
  - `alert(options)`: Shows an alert dialog (returns Promise).
  - `custom(component, props)`: Renders a custom SafeDOM component within a BaseModal.

### 2. Standard Modal Components (`public/js/components/ui/modals/`)
Reusable, stateless components constructed with SafeDOM.
- **`ConfirmModal.js`**: Renders title, message, and Confirm/Cancel buttons.
- **`InputModal.js`**: Renders title, input field (with validation support), and Save/Cancel buttons.

### 3. Toast Modernization (`public/js/components/Toast.js`)
- Refactor the existing module to construct DOM elements using `SafeDOM` instead of template strings.
- Maintain exact API compatibility (`showToast`, `toast.success`, etc.).

## 🔄 Migration Strategy (The "Modal-Swap" Operation)

### Phase 1: Infrastructure
1.  Create `ConfirmModal` and `InputModal`.
2.  Implement `DialogService` logic manually (no library deps).

### Phase 2: Refactor Consumers (Replacing `Modals.js`)
We will replace calls in `Modals.js` with `DialogService` equivalents in the consuming files.

| Legacy Method | Replacement Pattern | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `showDeleteAlbumModal` | `DialogService.confirm({...})` | Simple "Are you sure?" |
| `showDeletePlaylistModal` | `DialogService.confirm({...})` | Includes track count in message |
| `showDeleteBatchModal` | `DialogService.confirm({...})` | Simple confirmation |
| `showEditSeriesModal` | `DialogService.prompt({...})` | Needs validation logic mapped to prompt |
| `showSavePlaylistsModal` | `DialogService.prompt({...})` | Needs default value support |

### Phase 3: Toast Hardening
- Rewrite `Toast.js` using `SafeDOM`.

## 🎨 UI/UX Strategy
- **Visuals**: Maintain the current "glass-morphism" aesthetic defined in `BaseModal`.
- **Interaction**:
  - **Promise-based API**: `await Dialog.confirm(...)` is cleaner than callback passing.
  - **Keyboard**: Ensure `Escape` to close and `Enter` to confirm work (already in BaseModal, verify for new components).
  - **Focus**: Auto-focus input in `InputModal`.

## 🧪 Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- None (limited test infrastructure for UI). We rely on manual verification.

### Manual Verification Checklist
1.  **Toast Test**:
    - Trigger `toast.success()` and `toast.error()`.
    - Verify icon rendering and animation.
    - Verify close button works.
2.  **Delete Flow (ConfirmModal)**:
    - Try to delete an Album (Inventory).
    - Try to delete a Playlist.
    - Verify "Cancel" closes without action.
    - Verify "Confirm" executes action.
3.  **Edit Flow (InputModal)**:
    - Edit a Series Name.
    - Verify validation (empty name should disable save or show error).
    - Verify "Save" updates the name.
4.  **Save Flow**:
    - Generate Playlists -> Click "Save to Library".
    - Verify Prompt shows default name.
    - Change name -> Save.

## 📝 Task List
1.  [ ] Create `public/js/components/ui/modals/ConfirmModal.js`
2.  [ ] Create `public/js/components/ui/modals/InputModal.js`
3.  [ ] Create `public/js/services/DialogService.js`
4.  [ ] Refactor `Toast.js` to SafeDOM
5.  [ ] Refactor `SeriesView.js` (Delete/Edit Series calls)
6.  [ ] Refactor `SavedPlaylistsController.js` (Delete/Edit Playlist calls)
7.  [ ] Refactor `InventoryController.js` (Delete Album calls)
8.  [ ] Refactor `PlaylistsExport.js` (Save Batch call)
9.  [ ] Delete `Modals.js`

## 🏷️ Feature: Batch Naming Consistency (Architecture Update)

### Goal
Establish a robust system for naming Playlist Batches across Creation, Regeneration, Editing, and Saving, preventing "Ghost Playlists" and ensuring UX consistency.

### Core Concepts
1.  **Creation Mode (Wizard)**: Uses `defaultBatchName` (Format: "TheAlbumBlender Playlist [YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm]") to allow "One-Click Save".
2.  **Edit Mode**: Preserves `originalBatchName`. Input defaults to this name.
3.  **Renaming**: System tracks `originalBatchName` vs `currentBatchName`. On Save, if they differ, the original batch is overwritten (deleted then re-saved) to prevent duplication.

### Data Flow Architecture
-   **Store (`playlistsStore.js`)**: Single Source of Truth.
    -   `defaultBatchName`: Set by Controllers on generation.
    -   `editContext`: Stores `{ originalBatchName, currentBatchName }`.
    -   `persistence`: Saves these states to `localStorage` to survive page refreshes.
-   **Controllers**:
    -   `BlendingController`: Centralizes default name generation.
    -   `PlaylistsController`: Handles "Save" logic (detecting Rename/Overwrite scenarios).

### Missing Gaps Addressing
-   **Export**: Now falls back to `defaultBatchName` if no custom name is entered.
-   **Persistence**: Store now saves `defaultBatchName` and `editContext` to `localStorage`.

# Sprint 16: Cleanup & Critical Integrity

**Status**: Planning
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-31
**Owner**: Agent 1 (Handover), Agent 2 (Execution)
**Goal**: Finalize the removal of legacy DOM manipulation patterns (`Modals.js`) and consolidate components.

## Context
Sprint 15 achieved major milestones in "SafeDOM" migration. The critical data loss bug in Apple Music Export was **resolved in Sprint 15 Phase 6** with lazy authorize + browser locale storefront.

> [!NOTE]
> **Sprint 15 Phase 6 Resolved**:
> - ✅ Lazy authorize (no popup on init)
> - ✅ Browser locale storefront for searches
> - ✅ `authorizeAndValidate()` for persist-time validation
> - ✅ Edit Modal refactored to use artist scan + filters (same as Home)
> - ✅ Deprecated `Autocomplete.js` and `MusicKitSearchAdapter.js` in SeriesModals

## Objectives

### 1. ~~Critical Integrity (The "Apple Fix")~~ ✅ RESOLVED IN SPRINT 15
> Moved to Sprint 15 Phase 6. Lazy authorize + browser locale implemented.

### 2. Legacy Eradication (The "Modals Fix")
- [ ] **Operation Modal-Swap**:
    - [ ] Create `src/components/ui/modals/ConfirmModal.js` (SafeDOM).
    - [ ] Create `src/components/ui/modals/InputModal.js` (SafeDOM).
    - [ ] Delete `Modals.js` entirely (~30 sinks).
- [ ] **Controller-First Refactor**:
    - [ ] Move remaining logic from `SavedPlaylistsView` to Controller.
    - [ ] Create `DialogService.js`: Views call `Dialog.confirm(...)`, not `new Modal()`.

### 3. Component Consolidation
- [ ] **Deprecate Legacy Cards**:
    - [ ] Deprecate `PlaylistCard` (replace with `Card`).
    - [ ] Deprecate `BatchGroupCard` (replace with `Card` or `TrackRow` list).
- [ ] **Standardize Lists**: Force all lists to use `TrackRow` or `Card`.

### 4. Architecture Hardening
- [ ] **Consolidate Stores**: Ensure `albumSeriesStore` and `albumsStore` have clear responsibilities.
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Run audit. Target: < 25 `innerHTML` sinks.

## Scope Exclusions
- No new features (e.g., new Ranking Strategies) until stability is restored.
- No UI redesigns.

## Success Metrics
- ~~**0 Data Loss** on Export.~~ ✅ Resolved in Sprint 15
- ~~**0 Crashes** on Album Remove.~~ ✅ Resolved in Sprint 15
- **`Modals.js` Deleted**.
- **`innerHTML` sinks < 25**.

# Sprint 16 Task List: Cleanup & Critical Integrity

**Goal**: Eradicate legacy patterns (`Modals.js`) and consolidate components.
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-31
**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## ~~Phase 1: Critical Integrity Recovery~~ ✅ RESOLVED IN SPRINT 15
> Moved to Sprint 15 Phase 6. See [phase6-hotfix-plan.md](../sprint15-arch12/phase6-hotfix-plan.md)

- [x] **Fix Export Logic**: Lazy authorize + browser locale storefront implemented.
- [x] **Fix Series Management**: Artist scan + filters in Edit modal (same as Home).

## Phase 2: Operation Modal-Swap (The "Modals.js" Killer)
*Goal: Replace ad-hoc `innerHTML` modals with proper components and Service.*

- [x] **Create Safe Modals**:
    - [x] `src/components/ui/modals/ConfirmModal.js`
    - [x] `src/components/ui/modals/InputModal.js`
- [x] **Create `DialogService.js`**:
    - [x] Implement `confirm()` and `prompt()` using new modals.
- [x] **Refactor Consumers**:
    - [x] `SeriesView.js` -> Use `DialogService`
    - [x] `PlaylistsView.js` -> Use `DialogService`
    - [x] `SavedPlaylistsView.js` -> Use `DialogService` (move logic to Controller).
- [x] **Delete Legacy**:
    - [x] Delete `public/js/components/Modals.js` 🗑️

## Phase 3: Component Consolidation
*Goal: Reduce maintenance by removing redundant components.*

- [x] **Deprecate Legacy Cards**:
    - [x] Refactor `BatchGroupCard` usages to use `Card`/`TrackRow`.
    - [x] Delete `PlaylistCard.js` (if exists/unused).
    - [x] Delete `BatchGroupCard.js`.
- [x] **Standardize**: Ensures all lists use `TrackRow` for items and `Card` for entities.

## Phase 4: Final Security Sweep
*Goal: Reach < 25 innerHTML sinks.*

- [x] **Audit Sinks**:
    - [x] Run `grep -r "innerHTML" public/js/` (Initial count > 40)
    - [x] Refactor `SeriesView.js` (Shell + Router support)
    - [x] Refactor `SavedPlaylistsView.js`
    - [x] Refactor `EditAlbumModal.js` & `BaseModal.js`
    - [x] Delete `ConfirmationModal.js` (Legacy)

    - [x] Refactor `RankingView.js` & `InventoryView.js`
    - [x] Refactor `BlendingMenuView.js`, `ConsolidatedRankingView.js`, `SaveAllView.js`
    - [x] Refactor remaining low-hanging fruit.

## Phase 5: Batch Naming Consistency (New)
*Goal: Fix UX issues with Playlist Naming (Ghost playlists, empty inputs).*

- [x] **Refactor `PlaylistsStore.js`**:
    - [x] Implement `defaultBatchName` state.
    - [x] Add `editContext` to track `originalBatchName`.
    - [x] Update `saveToLocalStorage` to persist these fields (fix Refresh bug).
- [x] **Refactor `BlendingController.js`**:
    - [x] Create `_generateDefaultBatchName` helper (Format: "TheAlbumBlender Playlist...").
    - [x] Call this helper in `generateFromSeries` (Wizard) and `regenerate`.
- [x] **Refactor `PlaylistsController.js`**:
    - [x] Update `handleSave` to use `editContext.originalBatchName` for overwrite target.
    - [x] Remove redundant default name logic (delegate to BlendingController).
- [x] **Refactor Export Logic**:
    - [x] Update `PlaylistsGridRenderer` / Export Utils to fallback to `defaultBatchName`.

## Bug Fixes & Regressions

# Code Quality Assessment v10.0

**Created**: 2026-01-02
**Status**: Sprint 15.5 Complete (Hotfix Release v3.15.5)
**Objective**: Assess codebase quality after Sprint 15.5 fixes and validate Sprint 16 priorities.
**Previous**: [v9.0](CODE_QUALITY_ASSESSMENT_v9.0.md)

## 📊 Executive Scorecard

| Metric Group | Specific Metric | v9.0 | v10.0 | Trend | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Componentization** | **UI Components** | 51 | 54 | 🟢 +3 | New components added |
| | **Domain Folders** | 9 | 12 | 🟢 +3 | Better organization (blend/, search/, series/) |
| | **Universal Components** | Card, TrackRow | Card, TrackRow, BaseModal | 🟢 | SafeDOM standard established |
| **Modularization** | **Controllers** | 5 | 5 | 🟡 Same | Pattern mature |
| | **Services** | 15 | 16 | 🟢 +1 | |
| | **Algorithms** | 16 | 16 | 🟡 Same | Strategy pattern stable |
| **Tech Health** | **innerHTML Files** | 48 | 48 | 🟡 Same | No regression, Sprint 16 focus |
| | **God Classes (>400 LOC)** | 1 | 2 | 🔴 +1 | SeriesView (421), CurationEngine (518) |
| **Legacy Cleanup** | **EntityCard/BaseCard** | Deleted | Deleted | ✅ | Completed Sprint 15 |
| | **Modals.js** | 17KB | 17KB | 🔴 Pending | **Sprint 16 Target** |

### Key Context (Why v9.0 Metrics Changed)

The v9.0 assessment showed "Component Density 4.65" and "Reusability 15%". These metrics **are no longer meaningful** because:

1. **`shared/` was intentionally restructured** - Legacy shared components were moved to domain-specific folders (`ui/`, `series/`, `playlists/`) for better cohesion.
2. **Universal SafeDOM pattern established** - `Card.js`, `TrackRow.js`, `BaseModal.js` in `ui/` now serve as the foundation for all domain components.
3. **Focus shifted to consolidation** - Sprint 16 explicitly targets deprecating `PlaylistCard`, `BatchGroupCard` → standardize on `Card`.

---

## 🎯 Sprint 16 Alignment (The "Modals Killer" Sprint)

The Sprint 16 spec (`docs/technical/specs/sprint16-cleanup/spec.md`) correctly prioritizes:

### ✅ Already Resolved (Sprint 15 / 15.5)
- ~~Critical Integrity (Apple Fix)~~ - Lazy authorize + browser locale
- ~~Export Data Loss~~ - v3.15.5 fixed invalid Apple Music IDs

### 🔴 Sprint 16 Priorities (Confirmed by Assessment)

| Priority | Objective | Current State | Target |
|----------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **P1** | Delete `Modals.js` | 17KB, 6 innerHTML | DialogService + BaseModal extensions |
| **P2** | Deprecate legacy cards | PlaylistCard, BatchGroupCard | Use `Card` component |
| **P3** | SavedPlaylistsView → Controller | Logic in View | Controller-first pattern |
| **P4** | innerHTML sinks | 48 files | < 25 files |

### Sprint 16 Success Criteria (Validated)
- ✅ `Modals.js` deleted - **Correct priority**
- ✅ `innerHTML` < 25 - **Achievable** (focus on Modals.js + SeriesModals.js + PlaylistsExport.js = -24 sinks)

---

## 🔮 Sprint 17 Alignment (Architectural Modularization)

The ROADMAP correctly identifies:

| Objective | Rationale | Assessment Validation |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **CurationEngine refactor** | 518 LOC God Class, multiple responsibilities | 🔴 **Newly Discovered** - Split into RankingSourceRegistry, TrackEnrichmentService, PlaylistBalancer |
| **MusicKitService split** | 692 LOC, multiple concerns (Auth, Catalog, Library) | ✅ Only remaining "God Service" |
| **SeriesView refactor** | 421 LOC (God Class View) | ✅ Extract SeriesController |
| **Store cleanup** | albumSeries.js duplication | ✅ Alignment with ARCH-2 pattern |

### CurationEngine Analysis (Overlooked in v9.0)

The `curation.js` file contains a **518 LOC God Class** with:
- 21 methods mixing multiple concerns
- Ranking source management
- Track enrichment logic (164 lines)
- Playlist balancing algorithms
- Nested helper functions

**Proposed Split**:
1. `RankingSourceRegistry.js` - Source registration/lookup
2. `TrackEnrichmentService.js` - `enrichTracks()` logic
3. `PlaylistBalancer.js` - `fillPlaylistIfNeeded`, `runFase4SwapBalancing`
4. `CurationEngine.js` (slim) - Orchestrator only

### Sprint 16 - No Changes Needed
The current spec is **well-aligned** with the assessment findings:
1. Focus on `Modals.js` elimination (highest legacy debt)
2. Component consolidation (Card/TrackRow standardization)
3. Controller-first pattern for SavedPlaylistsView

### Sprint 17 - Minor Adjustment Suggested
Add explicit task for **SeriesView** refactor (421 LOC → <300 LOC) alongside MusicKitService split.

# Code Quality Assessment v10.1 (Onboarding Verification)

**Created**: 2026-01-03
**Status**: Onboarding Verification
**Objective**: Verify findings from v10.0 and establish baseline for Antigravity Agent.
**Previous**: [v10.0](CODE_QUALITY_ASSESSMENT_v10.0.md)

---

## 📊 Verification Scorecard

| Metric | v10.0 Claim | v10.1 Finding | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SeriesView LOC** | 421 | 500 | 🔴 **Degraded** (+79 lines) |
| **CurationEngine LOC** | 518 | 518 | 🟡 Verified (High) |
| **Modals.js** | "Pending" (17KB) | **Not Found** | ❓ Deleted? |
| **Autocomplete.js** | "Pending" (5KB) | **Found** (5.5KB) | 🟠 Verified (Pending) |

### Key Observations

1.  **SeriesView Expansion**: `SeriesView.js` has grown to 500 lines, pushing it firmly into "God Class" territory (>500 LOC). This reinforces the need for the **Sprint 17 SeriesView refactor**.
2.  **Modals.js Mystery**: The v10.0 report listed `Modals.js` as a "Sprint 16 P1 Priority" and "Pending". However, it is not present in `public/js/components/`. It may have been deleted or moved without updating the previous report, or `SeriesModals.js` (which exists) is the intended target.
3.  **CurationEngine Stability**: The 518 LOC count is stable, confirming the complexity of this class. The proposed split in v10.0 remains valid.

---

## 🎯 Onboarding Conclusion

The codebase follows the Architecture defined in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Strengths**: V3 Component architecture (SafeDOM), Universal `Card` usage.
- **Weaknesses**: Growing View monoliths (`SeriesView`), Complex Service Logic (`CurationEngine`, `MusicKitService`).
- **Next Steps**: Proceed with Sprint 16 "Cleanup" items, specifically verifying the `Modals.js` situation and ensuring `Autocomplete.js` is fully deprecated.

## 📊 Executive Scorecard

| Metric Group | Specific Metric | Formula/Definition | Target | **v4.0** | **v5.0 Current** | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Componentization (UI)** | **Density** | Total Components / Total Views | >3.0 | 1.45 | **3.08** | 🟢 Target Met |
| | **Reusability** | Shared Components / Total Components | >40% | 12.5% | **5.0%** | 🔴 Critical Drop |
| **Modularization (Logic)** | **Decoupling** | Modules with 0 DOM refs / Total Logic | 100% | 96% | **98%** | 🟢 Excellent |
| | **Logic-to-View** | LOC (Logic) / LOC (Views) | >1.0 | 1.41 | **~0.35** | 🔴 Regression |

| | **Async Safety** | Error Handling Coverage (API) | 100% | 85% | **95%** | 🟢 Improving |

> **Note on Logic-to-View Regression**: The significant drop is due to `PlaylistsView.js` expanding to 960 LOC to handle complex UI state (Modals, Drag & Drop), while logic was extracted to small, focused Services (e.g., `PlaylistGenerationService` is only 143 LOC). Code is modular, but Views remain heavy orchestrators.

## 🔴 Priority Matrix (The "Top 5 Fixes")

| File Path | Lines | Score | Main Violation | Actionable Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `public/js/views/PlaylistsView.js` | 960 | 🔴 2 | **God Class** (Grew from 753 LOC). Handles Modals, Drag, Fetching, and Render. | Extract `PlaylistGridRenderer` and `PlaylistActionHandler`. |
| `public/js/views/SavedPlaylistsView.js` | 589 | 🟠 4 | **Monolith**. Duplicates logic from PlaylistsView. | Inheritance refactor or Composition with `PlaylistGrid`. |
| `public/js/views/BlendingMenuView.js` | 488 | 🟡 5 | **High Complexity**. multiple mixes of UI and Algo logic. | Extract `BlendConfigurationPanel` as pure UI. |
| `public/js/components/*` | - | 🔴 2 | **Security**. 49 instances of `innerHTML`. | Global Replace: Use `textContent` or strict Sanitizer. |
| `public/js/api/client.js` | 524 | 🟡 6 | **Bloated Client**. Handles too many specific transforms. | Move `TrackTransformer` logic fully out and split API by domain. |

---

## 🧩 Domain Analysis

### A. Frontend Componentization (UI focused)
- **Status**: **High Quantity, Low Reuse**. We successfully broke down the UI into 40+ components, hitting our Density target.
- **Problem**: Most components are hyper-specific (e.g., `BlendFlavorCard` vs `PlaylistCard` vs `BatchGroupCard`). There is little shared DNA.
- **Risks**: Maintenance nightmare. Changing a "Card" style requires updating 5 different component files.

### B. Logic Modularization (Logic/Backend)
- **Status**: **Strong Service Layer**. The new `PlaylistGenerationService` and `PlaylistPersistenceService` are exemplary—small, pure, and testable.
- **Problem**: The wiring (Controller logic) is still leaking into the Views. `PlaylistsView` manually orchestrates too much service interaction.

### C. Performance & Security
- **Security**: **Critical**. `innerHTML` is used for rendering text in Cards and Lists. This is a persistent vulnerability.
- **Performance**: Good. New specialized stores and optimized hydration logic in `client.js` have improved perceived performance.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate (Sprint 14)
1.  **Operation "Safe Text"**: A dedicated task to replace all `innerHTML` with `textContent` for dynamic values. This is non-negotiable for production security.
2.  **Shared "Card" Component**: Refactor `PlaylistCard`, `BatchGroupCard`, and `BlendFlavorCard` to share a common `BaseCard` or UI shell.
3.  **Extract Renderer**: `PlaylistsView` should delegate rendering to `PlaylistsGridRenderer.js`, checking out 200+ LOC.

### Architectural (Long-term)
1.  **View Composition Pattern**: Views should only be **Controllers** that mount **Container Components**. Current Views do too much direct DOM work.
2.  **Sanitization Pipe**: If `innerHTML` is absolutely needed (for formatting), strict DOMPurify pipelines must be enforced.

## 🧩 Domain Analysis

### A. Modal Architecture (Urgent)
> **Status**: Inconsistent & Fragmented
> **Findings**:
> - **God Files**: `Modals.js` (6 modals) and `InventoryModals.js` (3 modals) bundle unrelated UI.
> - **Duplication**: `escapeHtml` reimplemented in **8 different files**.
> - **Behavior**: Escape key, Backdrop click, and Animation logic repeated manually in every modal.
> - **V3 Compliance**: Only `SeriesModals.js` follows the class-based V3 pattern.

### B. Logic Modularization
> **Status**: Strong in V3 areas, weak in Legacy
> - ✅ **SeriesView**: 100% Decoupled (Controller manages logic).
> - ✅ **PlaylistsView**: 100% Decoupled.
> - ✅ **BlendingMenuView**: 100% Decoupled.
> - ❌ **InventoryView**: 0% Decoupled (Direct Store/Service calls in View).

### C. Security & "Safe Text"
> **Status**: Critical Vulnerability
> - **Issue**: Widespread adoption of `${this.escapeHtml(text)}` inside template strings injected via `innerHTML`.
> - **Risk**: One missed escape call = XSS vulnerability.
> - **Fix**: Move to `document.createElement` + `textContent` for dynamic data (V3 Renderer pattern).

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Sprint 14)

1.  **InventoryView V3 Refactor (P0)**
    *   Goal: Break the largest remaining God Class.
    *   Create: `InventoryController.js` and `InventoryGridRenderer.js`.
    *   Move: Modal logic out of view.

2.  **Modal Refactor Phase 1 (P1)**
    *   Create `components/modals/BaseModal.js` (Shared logic for open/close/animate).
    *   Consolidate `escapeHtml` into `utils/stringUtils.js`.
    *   Refactor `Modals.js` into individual components.

3.  **Resolve #92 Album Cache Issue (P0)**
    *   Fix data integrity issue where cache keys differ from album identity.

### Architectural Roadmap (Sprint 15+)

1.  **HomeView & SavedPlaylistsView V3**: Apply the Thin Orchestrator pattern.
2.  **Shared Component Library**: Extract `BaseCard`, `Button`, and `Input` to standard components to improve Reusability (currently 4.2%).
3.  **Strict Security Pipeline**: Enforce `no-innerHTML` lint rule.

## 🧩 Domain Analysis

### A. Security Audit (Urgent)
> **Status**: Critical Vulnerability
> **Findings**:
> - **53 files** use `innerHTML` or `+=` HTML injection.
> - **8 definitions** of `escapeHtml` found (7 local + 1 utility).
> - **Risk**: Inconsistent escaping logic across the app. If one implementation is flawed, XSS is possible.
> - **Violators**: `Modals.js`, `InventoryModals.js`, `InventoryView.js`, `Toast.js`, etc. redefine `escapeHtml` locally.

### B. Logic Modularization
> **Status**: Excellent Progress
> - ✅ **InventoryView**: Now follows V3 Pattern (Controller + Renderer).
> - ✅ **Decoupling**: All major views (`Series`, `Playlists`, `Blending`, `Inventory`) now have decoupled controllers.
> - ⚠️ **Legacy**: `HomeView` and `SavedPlaylistsView` are the last major views needing refactor.

### C. Modal Architecture
> **Status**: Fragmented
> - **God Files**: `Modals.js` and `InventoryModals.js` need splitting.
> - **Base Implementation**: Missing `BaseModal` to handle common behavior (Escape key, Backdrop click).

---

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Sprint 14)

1.  **Operation "Safe Text" (Security P0)**
    *   Consolidate `escapeHtml` into `utils/stringUtils.js`.
    *   Remove all 7 local re-definitions.
    *   Systematically replace `innerHTML` with `textContent` where possible, or use a sanitizer.

2.  **Modal Architecture Clean-up (P1)**
    *   Create `components/modals/BaseModal.js`.
    *   Refactor `Modals.js` and `InventoryModals.js` into atomic components.

3.- [ ] **ARCH-11: HomeView Refactor** (Priority: High)
  - **Status**: [IN PROGRESS](file:///c:/Users/Mauricio%20Pedroso/VibeCoding/MyProjects/MJRP_AlbumsBalancedPlaylists_v0/docs/technical/specs/sprint14-home-refactor/arch-11-home-v3-spec.md)
  - **Proto**: `static_prototype_v3.html`
  - **Specs**: Split-Panel Layout, Controllers.

### Architectural Roadmap (Sprint 15+)

1.  **Shared Component Library**: Extract `BaseCard` to reduce code duplication (currently 4.2% reusability).
2.  **Automated Security Checks**: Add ESLint rules to prevent new `innerHTML` usage.

## 🧩 Domain Analysis

### A. Security Audit (Urgent - Phase 4)
> **Status**: 🔴 Critical Vulnerability
> **Findings**:
> - **52 files** still use `innerHTML` (1 reduction from `SavedPlaylistsView` clean up).
> - **High Risk Areas**: `Modals.js`, `Toast.js`, and all `*Renderer.js` files using template literals for HTML generation.
> - **Recommendation**: Phase 4 MUST be executed. We cannot ship V3 with this many sinks.

### B. Logic Modularization
> **Status**: 🟢 Excellent Progress
> - **SavedPlaylistsController**: Successfully implemented. Pure logic, no DOM manipulation.
> - **State Management**: `PlaylistsStore` now robustly handles "Edit" vs "Create" modes (Resolution of Issue #99).

### C. UI Componentization
> **Status**: 🟡 In Progress (The "Tipping Point")
> - We now have the **Core Trio**: `Card`, `TrackRow`, `BaseModal`.
> - **Challenge**: They exist but are only used in 20% of views.
> - **Goal**: Phase 3 is about "Holistic Migration" - making `Card` and `TrackRow` the standard across the entire app.

---

## 🎯 Sprint 15 Critical Phase Review

### Phase 3: Holistic Migration (The "Grind")
**Status**: ⏳ Ready to Start
**Risk**: High (Regression potential)
**Focus**:
1.  **Rankings**: `RankingView` & `ConsolidatedRankingView` -> Use `TrackRow`.
2.  **Grid Views**: `InventoryView` & `AlbumsView` -> Use `Card`.
3.  **Consistency**: Ensure identical behavior between old and new generic components.

### Phase 4: Security Hardening (Zero Tolerance)
**Status**: ⏳ Pending
**Risk**: Medium (Tedious but necessary)
**Strategy**:
- **Sanitizer First**: Introduce `DOMPurify` or custom sanitizer.
- **Render Functions**: Move from string concatenation to `document.createElement` loops where possible (performance gain + security).
- **Strict Content**: Enforce `textContent` for all user inputs.

## 🧩 Domain Analysis

### A. Security Audit (Phase 4 Success)
> **Status**: 🟠 Significant Progress
> **Findings**:
> - **Critical Views Protected**: Ranking and Inventory (high traffic/interaction) are now XSS-safe.
> - **Legacy Sinks**: Remaining `innerHTML` is mostly in `Modals.js` (legacy alerts) and low-traffic admin utilities, or inside `SafeDOM` adapter itself.
> - **Zero Tolerance**: We successfully enforced a "No innerHTML" policy for all *new* and *refactored* code (Sprint 15).

### B. Logic Modularization
> **Status**: 🟢 Excellent
> - **SafeDOM Integration**: The `SafeDOM` utility proved robust, handling complex layouts (nested flex, grids, event listeners) without regression.
> - **Controller Pattern**: `InventoryController` and `RankingController` (implicit in View) logic is separate from DOM construction.

### C. UI Componentization
> **Status**: 🟢 Good (Standardized)
> - **Universal Card**: `Cards.js` now powers both Inventory Grid and Series Grid.
> - **Universal Row**: `TrackRow.js` powers Ranking Tables and Playlist Rows.
> - **Consolidation**: Removed `EntityCard` and `BaseCard`, reducing confusion.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations (Sprint 16+)

### Immediate
1.  **Kill `Modals.js`**: It's the last major bastion of `innerHTML` templates. Convert to `BaseModal` instances.
2.  **Sanitize Remaining Sinks**: Even if we can't refactor everything, wrap remaining `innerHTML` assignments in a `Sanitize` helper.

### Architectural
1.  **Component Registry**: Formalize `components/index.js` to potentially support lazy loading.
2.  **State Machines**: Complex views like `EditPlaylistView` could benefit from explicit State Machines (XState or simple FSM) instead of boolean flags.
