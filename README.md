# VibeCoding — Local Dev Notes & Architecture

This repository contains a small static frontend (under `public/`) and a lightweight local proxy server (under `server/`) used to forward AI requests to a provider (Gemini / Google Generative Language) so API keys remain on the server and are not exposed to the browser.

This README documents the code layout, how the proxy works, how to run the project locally, and recommended security / git hygiene steps.

## Project layout

This README was updated to reflect recent refactors: the client API layer (`public/js/api.js`) was extracted, a server-side JSON Schema validator using `ajv` was added, and a client batch helper `fetchMultipleAlbumMetadata` is available for importing many albums with concurrency and retries.
  - `public/css/style.css` — styles extracted from the original inline CSS.

  - `server/index.js` — implements `/api/generate`, `/api/list-models` and `/_health`. The server reads `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_ENDPOINT` and `AI_MODEL` from environment variables.
  - `server/package.json` — server dependencies (`axios`, `cors`, `dotenv`, `express`).


## What the proxy does

  - If `AI_ENDPOINT` indicates Google Generative Language, the proxy builds a `generateContent` request calling an explicit model (defaults to `models/gemini-2.5-flash`) and attaches the API key as a query parameter.
  - The proxy attempts to normalize responses to return a single `data` object `{ data: <album> }` when the provider returns stringified JSON inside `candidates[0].content.parts[0].text` or when the provider returns an object with `tracks`.
  - On error, the proxy forwards provider error payloads with the appropriate HTTP status.

## Running locally (dev)

1. Install server deps:

```bash
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

2. Create a local `.env` (this file must NOT be committed):

```text
AI_API_KEY=YOUR_REAL_KEY_HERE
AI_ENDPOINT=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1
AI_MODEL=models/gemini-2.5-flash
PORT=3000
```

3. Start the proxy:

```bash
cd server
node index.js
# or use nodemon in dev: npx nodemon index.js
```

4. Serve the `public/` directory (for example using a static server on port 8000):

```bash
# from repo root
python3 -m http.server 8000 -d public
```

 - Open `http://localhost:8000/hybrid-curator.html` and use the app; client calls `http://localhost:3000/api/generate` to request album metadata (unless overridden by `window.__api_base`).

## Security & git hygiene


### Recommended cleanup workflow (manual review + backup)

1. Create a backup branch:

```bash
git branch pre-secrets-cleanup-backup
```

2. Inspect commits for secrets (example search):

```bash
git rev-list --all | xargs -n1 git grep -n "AIza" --line-number --no-index || true
```

3. Remove files from history using `git filter-repo` (recommended):

```bash
pip3 install git-filter-repo
git filter-repo --invert-paths --paths .env --paths .env.example
```

4. Run `git gc` and verify secrets are gone. Do NOT force-push to any shared remote until you coordinate with collaborators.

If `git filter-repo` is not available, `git filter-branch` can be used, but it is slower and deprecated.

## Notes and troubleshooting


## Where to continue


If you'd like, I can perform the safe, non-destructive steps now (create backup branch, add & commit safe files). I will not rewrite history or push anything to remotes without explicit confirmation.

Generated by developer tooling during a local refactor to extract client JS/CSS and add an AI request proxy. Keep secrets out of this repository.
