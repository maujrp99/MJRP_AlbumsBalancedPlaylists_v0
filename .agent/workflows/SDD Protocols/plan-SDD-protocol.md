### 2. Planning Phase (`plan.md`)
**Goal**: Define HOW (Architecture, UI/UX, Component Strategy).
1. Agent creates/updates `docs/technical/specs/<feature>/plan.md`.
2. Agent includes logic flows and **UI Mockups** (Critical for frontend).
3. Agent requests User Review.
4. User validates strategy and visuals.
5. **Gate**: Cannot proceed to Task List until Plan is APPROVED.
