Do not create new documents, use the existing ones (not those in the archive) to keep the tracking of bug fixes as logs. Always use timestamp in the updated documents. If questions on where to update, ask the user.

Do not ever delete information from documentation, unless explicitly requested by the user. Just move the text and label it if you think it's deprecated, or mark as deprecated or old.
