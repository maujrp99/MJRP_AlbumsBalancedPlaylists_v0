Follow the documentation-protocol in the workflows folder. Always use timestamp in the created content and updated documents and keep them in desecending chronological orders. If questions on where to update, ask the user.

Do not ever delete information from documentation, unless explicitly requested by the user. Just move the text and label it if you think it's deprecated, or mark as deprecated or old, because it will be assessed later in the documentation-audit workflow if it can be deleted.
