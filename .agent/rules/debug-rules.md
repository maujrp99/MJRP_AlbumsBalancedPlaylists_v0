Be compliant: For reported bug fixing, fixes and improvements/enhancements, always follow what is in the debug_protocol.md
Do not ever delete things from the debug log, unless explicitly requested by the user. Just move the text and label if you think it's deprecated, mark as deprecated or old.

### **Code Review Rules**
1. 🛡️ **Be Constructive**: Explain WHY something is wrong
2. 💡 **Suggest Solutions**: Don't just point out errors
3. 🎯 **Focus on Architecture**: Patterns matter more than style, check ARCHITECTURE.md 
4. 🚫 **Block Bad Code**: Don't approve Critical/High issues
