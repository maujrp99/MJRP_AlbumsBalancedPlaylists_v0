###GOLDEN RULES
Always ask if you have full project context and what is the full context of the demand.
Read carefully all the documentation and point out contradictions to be addressed.
After implement a feature, or a fix, always document or update the documentation.
Always log the failed attempts to fix an issue/problem in the debug log .md, as well as the solution only if the user confirmed it is really done.
Nunca marca nada como fixed ou done, enquanto o usuário não confirmar que está OK.
